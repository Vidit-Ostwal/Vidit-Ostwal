  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that including context and information about the manager LLM's tools and agents is a valuable addition. However, they express concern that adding a "manager_note" specifically for the manager LLM might not be ideal, as it's essentially just another agent internally. They also propose exploring the possibility of instructing*
