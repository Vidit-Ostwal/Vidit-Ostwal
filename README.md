  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue might be related to a recent update with the fsspec library. This update could be affecting functionality or causing unexpected behavior in the project. It is important to investigate how the changes in the fsspec library may have contributed to the problem at hand, as it could provide insights into potential solutions or workarounds necessary to resolve the current issue. Careful examination and testing may be required to validate this hypothesis.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/8) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Google COLAB setup issue (2025-05-18).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while setting up a process on Google Colab, an error has been encountered related to an invalid pattern in the code. The specific issue arises from a ValueError indicating that '**' can only be used as an entire path component. The error occurs during the dataset loading phase, implying that the configuration for the dataset might be incorrect. The issue suggests that attention should be given to how paths are structured in the code, likely requiring adjustments for successful execution.*
