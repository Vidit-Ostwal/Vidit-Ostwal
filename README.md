  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that after downgrading to version 0.203.1, issues with hallucinated outputs ceased. They inquired about a migration guide for version 1+, expressing concerns that the tool's behavior has changed significantly post-upgrade. They found using CrewAI to be a valuable learning experience, yet upgrading to version 1.x introduced challenges. They recommend trying a specific configuration option to revert to using an earlier model while highlighting that the latest version ideally should rely on the native SDK instead of the older model.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that only two environments were identified where smolagents are installed: coding_env and git_env. They seek clarification on whether there are any other environments from which smolagents need to be removed in the Docker file. The comment emphasizes the need to ensure the environment configurations are consistent and suggests an update to other environments as appropriate, indicating a collaborative approach to maintain the project standards.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating other environments to align with the recent change made. It was highlighted that a rebase might be necessary to incorporate another change related to building dependencies using a requirements file for those environments. Additionally, a commitment to investigate further on this matter has been expressed. The goal is to ensure consistency across all environments regarding the updates being made, which is critical for seamless functionality and integration.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested checking the CI errors, indicating there were issues that needed attention. However, it's noted that all fixes have been successfully implemented, resolving the problems previously encountered. This implies that the necessary corrections were made to ensure smooth continuous integration, reflecting a proactive approach to addressing potential impediments in the workflow. Overall, the situation has been addressed, and everything should now function as intended without outstanding errors related to continuous integration.*

## 🐛 Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error message occurs when attempting to create a task with a context parameter set to None. The expected behavior should allow for configuration without issues. This was observed on macOS Sonoma while using Python 3.11 and the latest versions of crewAI and crewAI Tools, within a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and potential solutions have been provided, including reference to a specific issue. No additional context has been noted related to this problem.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is a missing case when a task is copied, particularly when the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED. In this scenario, the current structure should result in the copied version of the task being set to None. The comment does not provide steps to reproduce, expected behavior, or evidence. It also mentions the operating system, Python version, crewAI version, tools version, and mentions a potential solution found in a linked pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there are important considerations relating to project structure and code organization. It is essential for maintainability and collaboration that developers adhere to best practices. Clear documentation and consistent naming conventions can significantly improve code readability and usability. Additionally, regular code reviews encourage knowledge sharing among team members. Implementing these strategies will ultimately lead to a more efficient workflow and higher quality software, fostering a productive and harmonious development environment.*
