  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior may be unique to the provided input tensor. They analyzed the code and determined that if the provided y_true and y_pred tensors are rescaled or computed using a larger dtype, the issue may be resolved. Alternatively, they suggest that using a different dtype*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying task 2 to use the output of task 1, without explicitly setting the parameters. They believe this will resolve the error related to finding the missing "detail" parameter, which occurs because `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` initializes parameters before crew kickoff.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the traces functionality to display traces in the format `{prompt_number}: {trace}`. New traces will be structured as JSON objects containing the prompt number, a dictionary of inputs and outputs, and relevant information such as prompt name, context, and statements. This updated format provides a more consistent*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the "Description" section of the documentation should replace "model" with "model_name" in the sample code examples that use the embedder. He noticed this inconsistency in the documentation pages for Azure OpenAI Embeddings, Google AI Embeddings, Vertex AI Embeddings, and Cohere Embeddings.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested introducing a JSON format option for the output_log_file, which currently has a .txt format. This enhancement would enable further data analysis and address part of issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request for this feature.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested looking into the role of `use_vision set = True` in defining an agent. They question whether it triggers multimodal processing of images by the multimodal LLM or if the process remains reliant on scraping elements. While they've observed that setting `use_vision = True` results in a .gif*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2031) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixed the memory documentation (2025-02-04).

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. Now, when initializing the crew, you can set `output_log_file` to True or provide a file name and enable `save_as_json` by setting it to True. This will create a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, making it*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a modification to the parse_run_traces function. The change involves incorporating the last four characters of the run_id of the trace. This modification ensures that each call has a unique key, addressing the ambiguity in trace key generation.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the validate_samples functionality to provide information about the specific indexed sample causing validation issues. This enhancement will improve the error reporting and make it easier to identify and resolve sample-related problems.*
