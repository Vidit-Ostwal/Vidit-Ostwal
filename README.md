  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a code change in the `validate_samples` method. The original code checked if all samples were of the same type, but did not provide detailed error messages for invalid samples. The updated code iterates through the samples and raises a `ValueError` with the index of the invalid sample*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the ragas version and correcting the JaccardSimilarityBuilder initialization. The provided code uses the wrong property name ("entities") and incorrect initialization parameters for the sample nodes, causing the errors. The correct property name is "page_content" and "key_name" should be removed since "page_content" is a string.*
