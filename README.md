  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior is due to specific input tensor values causing the variance of predis to be close to zero, leading to wrong results. They suggest considering re-scaling the input or computing using a larger dtype. In their own tests with different input tensors, the expected*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the error in `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` is due to the absence of the `detail` parameter. To resolve this, they recommend modifying `task 2` to use the output from `task 1` without explicitly specifying the parameters. Instead, the description should indicate that `task 2` should take the `detail` parameter*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the documentation for using embeddings should replace the `model_name` parameter with `model` in the input for the embedder. This discrepancy is evident in the code examples provided in the documentation for Azure OpenAI Embeddings, Google AI Embeddings, Vertex AI Embeddings, and Cohere Embeddings.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON format option to the `output_log_file` for better parsability and analysis. This feature request is partially related to issue #1970. They express willingness to contribute a pull request for this implementation.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the use of `use_vision set = True` when defining an agent, specifically whether it triggers multimodal processing of images or merely saves a .gif without affecting the output. The user also inquires about any cost metric to ascertain whether multimodal image processing is occurring. Additionally, they*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2031) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixed the memory documentation (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix to address the documentation issues flagged in issue #2030. However, specific details about the code changes or the nature of the documentation updates are not provided in this comment.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. When initializing the crew, users can set output_log_file to True or specify a file name and enable save_as_json to True. This will generate a .json file containing an array of JSON events, simplifying parsing and working with logs.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the parse_run_traces function to include the last 4 letters of the trace's run ID in the unique key assigned to each call, thereby improving the uniqueness of the key.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the `validate_samples` functionality to identify the specific indexed sample responsible for errors. This enhancement will provide more detailed information about encountered issues, making it easier to pinpoint and resolve the underlying problems.*
