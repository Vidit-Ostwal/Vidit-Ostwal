  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested investigating the issue of increasing memory usage in relation to the max_range variable. They expressed a desire to understand the underlying reasons for this memory increase, indicating curiosity about the relationship between the two factors. This inquiry aims to delve deeper into the problem to clarify why the memory allocation rises alongside the max_range, which is important for diagnosing potential issues or optimizing performance in the context being discussed.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3786#issuecomment-3438698097) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-10-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested creating a replica of a previous pull request within the deprecated crewai-tools library. This action emphasizes the intent to maintain the functionality or address specific issues from the original pull request, even though the library is no longer actively supported. The suggestion highlights a proactive approach to software maintenance, ensuring that important features or fixes are accessible despite the deprecation status of the library, thereby helping others who might still rely on it for their development needs.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/485#issuecomment-3438661519) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools] on 2025-10-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the deprecated repository should be included in the main repository. They were previously unaware of the deprecation of the crewAI tools. Following this realization, they plan to create a new pull request to implement the necessary changes. This indicates a proactive approach towards updating the main repository and ensuring that any deprecated elements are addressed appropriately. The suggestion aims at maintaining the relevance and functionality of the main repository by integrating necessary updates.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested expressing gratitude for the assistance received, indicating that it was instrumental in successfully implementing a function. The appreciation highlights the collaborative effort and acknowledges the support provided, marking a positive outcome as a result of teamwork. The enthusiasm is evident, reflecting satisfaction with the progress made due to the shared expertise. This sentiment underscores the importance of community support in achieving coding milestones and fostering a productive environment for development.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using system exit is not a good design choice for production systems, as it hinders integration with larger systems that may need to respond to such events. Instead, implementing an exception that permits the agent to attempt an alternative solution is more sensible. Additionally, it is recommended to set a specific parameter to true, enabling functionality to summarize if the context window limit is exceeded, thereby enhancing the system's adaptability.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to configure a task with the context parameter set to None on macOS Sonoma using Python 3.11 and the latest crewAI version. The expected behavior is for the configuration to proceed without issues. The comment includes evidence and possible solutions referencing a specific issue number. Screenshots and other relevant details have been provided. This indicates a need for troubleshooting to resolve the encountered error effectively.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is an oversight when tasks are copied, specifically when the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED. In this situation, the current structure should be adjusted so that the copied version of the task is set to None. The comment does not provide steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, or any additional context. It mentions the operating system as Ubuntu 20.04, Python version 3.11, and the latest crewAI and tools version, indicating a potential solution may exist in a linked pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a review of the current codebase is necessary to identify any outdated methods and improve overall efficiency. He emphasizes the importance of updating dependencies to enhance security and performance. Additionally, he recommends enhancing the documentation to better assist new contributors, ensuring clarity in the project's purpose. By implementing these changes, the project can be made more accessible and maintainable for the developer community, ultimately fostering a better collaborative environment.*
