  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the traces functionality to include "{prompt_number} : {trace}" format, enhancing the readability of trace information. New traces will now display in an organized manner, where each prompt is assigned a unique number followed by its corresponding trace data. This improvement simplifies the identification and interpretation of*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the development of features that do not align with the maintainers' vision should be avoided. He is facing an issue where latency becomes a problem with multiple API hits. The solution proposed partially solves his issue. He believes that latency-solving features will eventually be necessary and*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).

- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested revising the documentation for the `use_vision` parameter in the agent definition. They noted that setting `use_vision` to `True` saves a .gif file, but it's unclear whether the screenshot is processed by a multimodal LLM or still relies on scraping elements. They also inquired about a cost metric*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
