- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3786#issuecomment-3438698097) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-10-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a replica of the recent pull request has been created in the deprecated crewai-tools library. This action highlights the need for attention to legacy systems, as it may facilitate better understanding or integration with newer developments. The reference to the original pull request indicates a desire to ensure continuity in features or functionalities, even when the tools are no longer actively maintained. This approach might help users of the deprecated library transition smoothly.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/485#issuecomment-3438661519) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools] on 2025-10-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the current repository should be added to the main repository since the existing one is deprecated. Acknowledging the deprecation of the crewAI tools, @Vidit-Ostwal plans to create a new pull request to implement this change. This move aims to ensure that the relevant tools remain accessible and updated within the main repository, addressing any potential issues arising from the deprecated status of the current repository.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using system exit is not a good design choice for production systems. This approach limits integration capabilities and prevents larger systems from responding effectively. Instead, implementing an exception that allows agents to attempt alternative solutions is preferable. Additionally, setting the respect_context_window to true would enable functionality to summarize when the context window exceeds its limit, offering a more effective handling mechanism for such situations in system design.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a custom listener to handle LLM stream chunk events within the event bus framework. This involves creating a class that inherits from the BaseEventListener and implementing a method to set up event listeners. The method should register an event handler that prints incoming LLM stream chunk events when they occur. This approach allows for efficient handling of streaming events in a structured manner, enhancing the overall functionality of the application.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error message is encountered when attempting to create a task with a context parameter set to None, even though the expected behavior is to configure without issues. This issue has been documented on macOS Sonoma, with Python version 3.11 and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools, under a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and possible solutions have been provided, indicating ongoing efforts to resolve the issue and improve functionality.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is a missing case when copying tasks, specifically when the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED. In such instances, the copied version of the task should be set to None. There are no specific steps to reproduce the issue nor expected behaviors mentioned. The comment also indicates the operating system being used is Ubuntu 20.04 with Python version 3.11 and the latest crewAI and crewAI tools versions, all operating within a virtual environment.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a clear set of guidelines for summarizing comments, emphasizing the importance of capturing all essential information. Key points include avoiding any mention of specific users, not providing any code examples, and ensuring that summaries are concise and straightforward. Furthermore, he highlights that summaries should not reference external links and must remain focused on the content of the comment, adhering to a strict word count to ensure clarity and efficiency in communication.*
