  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that this behavior is possibly caused by specific input tensors and recommends investigating the variance of the input tensors. According to the provided code, when the variance of input tensors (var_x and var_y) is close to zero, a warning is raised to alert potential instability in the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the `task2` to avoid the error caused by the absence of the `detail` parameter in the `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` function. Instead of setting the `detail` parameter explicitly, the function should only take the output of `task1`, without specifying any specific parameters.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the traces functionality to display `{prompt_number} : {trace}`. The new traces will showcase a prompt with its corresponding name, input, and output, providing a comprehensive view of the trace details. Here's an example of a revised trace: ``` { 'prompt_1': { 'name': 'claim_decomposition_prompt', 'input': 'ClaimDecompositionInput(response='Eifel tower*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a change to the flow that makes it easier for users to understand. Implementing this change should be relatively straightforward. @jjmachan is requested to provide input on the proposed solution. If approved, @Vidit-Ostwal will update the PR with the necessary modifications.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON format option to the output_log_file, which is currently in a non-parsable .txt format. They believe this would be useful for further analysis and partially addresses issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request to implement this feature.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal inquired about the use of `use_vision set = True` and its influence on multimodal AI (LLM). They observed that while a GIF is saved with this setting, the output doesn't seem to differ. They also question if there's a metric for verifying multimodal image processing. Regarding code, @Vidit-Ostwal mentioned*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file by setting the output_log_file parameter to True or a file name like "log.json" and enabling save_as_json to True. This will generate a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, simplifying parsing and further processing of logs.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the `parse_run_traces` function to include the last four letters of the `run_id` of the trace. This modification ensures that each call has a unique key, enhancing the distinctiveness of the keys.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the validate_samples functionality to include information about the specific indexed sample causing any issues encountered during validation. This enhancement will provide more granular insights into the source of validation problems.*
