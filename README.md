  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that after downgrading to version 0.203.1, the issues experienced with hallucinated outputs ceased. They inquired about a migration guide for version 1+, noting significant behavioral changes that complicate the experience with CrewAI. Despite the challenges faced during the upgrade to version 1.x, it has been a valuable learning opportunity. They recommend trying a specific configuration with the latest version of CrewAI to enable fallback functionality, while emphasizing the importance of utilizing the native SDK instead of relying on external solutions.*
