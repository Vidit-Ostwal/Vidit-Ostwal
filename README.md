  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested removing the tool and running the process again to verify if the issue lies within the tool configuration or if it is related to crew. This approach aims to isolate the source of the problem, enabling a clearer understanding of where the fault may originate. By executing this step, it may help in diagnosing potential configuration issues or other underlying factors affecting the overall functionality.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that CrewAI's reliance on prompting may lead to inconsistent JSON outputs, potentially resulting in responses that are not as optimal as those configured directly at the LLM level using response formats. Additionally, there have been recent concerns about the performance of Gemini models, particularly regarding their ability to provide responses in a definitive format. This highlights the need for improved response consistency and configuration options in AI models to enhance reliability.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reviewing the use of a specific class from Crewai for configuring the LLM. They noted that Crewai offers its own class of LLM that could be more appropriate for the current implementation. It's implied that this alternative may offer advantages or better functionality. Therefore, a switch to using Crewai's LLM class could enhance performance or usability in the project’s context. Reviewing Crewai's documentation for details on this class may provide further insights.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested attempting to use the output_json variable specifically at the task level. This approach may help clarify or resolve any issues encountered in the current implementation. Focusing on the task level for the output_json could provide more structured data, potentially leading to better insights or performance. It's important to test this suggestion to evaluate its effectiveness in improving the overall functionality of the project.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it would be a good idea to update the version, noting that several new versions have been released since the current one. This update is likely necessary to ensure the project remains current and benefits from any improvements or fixes introduced in the latest versions. Keeping the software updated is essential for maintaining functionality and security. Therefore, it is advisable to review and implement the latest updates for optimal performance.*
