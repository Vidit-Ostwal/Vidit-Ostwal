  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring how different options for `attn_implementation` affect resource usage, emphasizing the "eager" implementation for its benefits. It is possible to experiment with alternative implementations that generally consume less VRAM. To modify the setting, adjust the `attn_implementation` parameter while loading the model. Additionally, thoughts on utilizing `unsloth.ai` for fine-tuning were shared, noting challenges with its documentation. Overall, the comment encourages experimentation with configurations to optimize resource usage effectively.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested awareness of the high VRAM requirements and expressed interest in creating a script to compute those needs. They mentioned ongoing work on LoRA to manage VRAM requirements effectively in the upcoming release. Furthermore, they are eager to contribute and have a basic understanding of how to calculate VRAM needs. Additionally, they are open to learning more and would appreciate any resources that could enhance their knowledge in this area.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested looking for other cloud services that offer GPU rental at lower rates compared to major providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Gathering information on alternative options could be beneficial for those seeking more cost-effective solutions for GPU resources. Any insights or suggestions regarding such services would be greatly appreciated, as it could assist many individuals in finding affordable cloud computing solutions. Thank you for considering this request for information.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the error indicates the absence of the MySQL module, which is optional and not automatically installed with embedchain. To resolve the issue, it is recommended to run a specific installation command to upgrade embedchain with the MySQL support. This should be executed in the user‚Äôs environment to ensure the necessary components are installed, allowing for the proper functioning of the embedchain application. Following this step should help in addressing the error encountered.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/9) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Finetuning GPU (2025-05-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested gratitude for the project's open-source aspect and raised a query about the resources needed for fine-tuning a Gemma-3 Model. They have experienced limitations with various platforms, including insufficient memory on Google Colab‚Äôs T4-GPU and P-100, and disconnections with Colab's TPU. Currently, they face challenges using multiple GPUs on Kaggle. They seek guidance on estimating training time for a single epoch of full fine-tuning and recommendations for the base configuration to use.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/8) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Google COLAB setup issue (2025-05-18).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while attempting to set up a project on Google Colab, they encountered a ValueError related to an invalid pattern in their dataset processing. The error originates when invoking the `get_dataloader` function, specifically during the dataset loading process with a specified split. This issue indicates that there is a problem with the dataset path pattern provided. They are seeking advice or solutions to resolve this error effectively.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2854) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added Stop parameter docs (2025-05-17).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating the stop parameter in the LLM documentation to enhance user experiences. This addition aims to improve the functionality by allowing users to control the generation of outputs more effectively. By implementing this feature, users can specify particular points where the model should halt its responses, which will lead to more relevant and tailored outputs. Overall, this recommendation seeks to refine the documentation for better clarity and usability in the area of LLM operations.*
