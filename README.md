  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue may be caused by a discrepancy between how `reset_memory_command` initializes `short_term_memory` and `entity_memory` from the CLI and how they are initialized within `crew.py`. While the command works for `long_term_memory` and `knowledge_memory`, which do not require arguments, it may not function properly if custom initialization*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior may be specific to the input tensors used. They have checked with different tensors and observed expected results, including `nan` when expected. The particular condition in the provided code snippet checks for variance close to zero, which could lead to instability in the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the code to address the error raised due to the absence of the `detail` parameter. They propose defining `task 2` without specifying the parameters and instead relying on the output of `task 1`, which should provide the necessary inputs. This approach eliminates the need to explicitly*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the traces functionality to include `{prompt_number} : {trace}` formatting. The new traces will resemble a more descriptive format, such as `{'prompt_1': {'name': 'claim_decomposition_prompt', 'input': ClaimDecompositionInput(response='Eiffel tower is in Paris'), 'output': ClaimDecompositionOutput(claims=['Eiffel tower is in Paris.'])}}`. This enhanced formatting provides a more organized and comprehensive representation of*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an inquiry regarding the `use_vision` parameter in agent definition. They question its functionality when set to `True`. Specifically, they ask if screenshots are processed differently by the multimodal LLM or if the agent still relies primarily on scraping elements for decision-making. Additionally, they express concern about whether*
