  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `reset_memory_command` might be causing the issue since it initializes `short_term_memory` and `entity_memory` differently than in `crew.py`. While `reset_memory_command` may work for `long_term_memory` and `knowledge_memory`, it may not function properly if custom initialization is used for any memory.*
