  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a more straightforward approach by modifying the `search` functionality within `user_memory`. The suggested change would involve adjusting the parameters of the `search` function to ensure compatibility with the current CrewAI codebase. However, Vidit-Ostwal acknowledges uncertainty regarding the extent of parameter manipulation possible. This uncertainty stems from potential*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an issue related to the `search` functionality within the `crewAI` framework, specifically involving compatibility with Mem0. A TypeError arises because the `Memory.search()` function receives an unexpected keyword argument, 'metadata'. Vidit-Ostwal acknowledges the error, attributing it to a lack of testing on their part. Further investigation reveals a*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that directly initializing a UserMemory() object is not possible due to the initialization of self.memory_config to crew.memory_config, which would result in a 'None' value in the present scenario. They have pointed out specific lines of code relevant to this issue. The suggestion highlights a limitation in the*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested several changes to improve the user context functionality. The first proposed modification involves an early return within the `_fetch_user_context` function. Secondly, to utilize the user_memory, users must configure specific settings including the memory provider and necessary attributes. A configuration dictionary with fields like `user_id`, `org_id`, and `project_id`*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reviewing a previously opened pull request addressing the same issue. They noted that the existing PR was created before the current one and seems to handle a broader range of error states. They requested a review of the older pull request first, implying a need to potentially*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested leveraging the user_memory parameter. They agree that incorporating it for setting user memory is a good approach. They propose fixing the user_memory configuration within the current pull request. However, they express confusion regarding the specific issue being addressed within the PR and seek clarification on the intended*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2255) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Issue while trying to initializing a google ai studio embedder in knowledge (2025-02-28).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested they are exploring knowledge implementation, drawing inspiration from a video, and adapting settings for Google AI Studio compatibility. However, they encounter an issue where knowledge initialization fails, citing a missing Google Generative AI package despite its presence in their environment. They provided logs showing the error message*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case to cover the changes made in response to issue #2260. The primary focus of the test case is to ensure that the fix implemented is effective and behaves as expected. The goal is to validate the correctness of the fix and prevent regressions*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448. The original code checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, which could be inefficient. The revised logic simplifies this by primarily verifying the presence of `memory_config`. If `user_memory` is a valid `UserMemory` instance, it's used directly. Otherwise, `self._user_memory` is initialized using*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are used within a crew and the `crewai run` CLI command is executed. This process inadvertently creates a virtual environment that treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is consistently installed,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the existing work in issue #2422. The focus of this contribution is to refine and improve the existing codebase. Specifically, the suggestion involves removing a test case that was deemed unnecessary or redundant. This action is intended to streamline the testing process and ensure that*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2408) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Branch 2402 (2025-03-19).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2402, building upon the work done in pull request #2403. The suggested solution includes modifications to the file structure. Additionally, the proposal incorporates test cases directly within the test_agent. The goal is to improve the robustness and reliability of the agent. This approach*
