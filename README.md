  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the error in the `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` function is due to the absence of the `detail` parameter. To resolve this, they recommend modifying the description of `task 2` to remove the explicit parameter specification. Instead, the task should specify that it takes the output of `task 1` as*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON logging format to the output_log_file. The current .txt format is not parsable and limits further analysis. Implementing JSON support would address this issue and partially resolve #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal expresses willingness to contribute a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reviewing the purpose of `use_vision set = True` when defining an agent. They inquire about the impact of this setting on the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, they question whether it triggers multimodal image processing by the LLM or relies on scraping elements. Vidit also asks for a*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an update to enable saving execution logs as a JSON file. By setting the output_log_file parameter to a filename and enabling save_as_json, users can generate JSON files containing an array of execution events. This simplifies parsing and analysis of log data.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a modification to the parse_run_traces function. The function now incorporates the last four characters of the run_id from the trace. This change assigns a distinctive key to each call, ensuring their uniqueness.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the `validate_samples` functionality to also identify the specific indexed sample responsible for any detected issues. This modification will aid in pinpointing the source of validation failures, simplifying the debugging process.*
