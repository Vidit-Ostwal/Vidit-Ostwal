  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that API latency can become problematic during periods of high request volume. They have encountered this issue themselves and recognize the need for a solution. While they acknowledge that the proposed solution only partially addresses the problem, they believe that latency issues will ultimately require attention from*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that allowing parallel processing of multiple requests is a crucial feature for production readiness. They acknowledge that currently, only one or two agents can work simultaneously due to dependencies. Additionally, scaling beyond 10 agents may introduce latency issues. @Vidit-Ostwal expresses interest in contributing to a potential PR*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that to resolve the issue where an undefined parameter `detail` is encountered in 'task2', an output class should be created for Task 1 with a field named `detail`. This class would allow for the output of one task to be used as input for another, facilitating communication*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested differentiating between the usage of Sequential and asynchronous kickoff based on the workflow of the agents. For sequential execution, where the output of one agent acts as input for another, Sequential is recommended. In contrast, asynchronous kickoff (kickoff()) is suitable for general use cases where there is*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format to the logging file named output_log_file. Currently, the file is in .txt format, making it difficult to parse. JSON format would allow for easier analysis and partially address issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request for this change.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring the purpose of the `use_vision` parameter when defining an agent. They inquire about whether it triggers image processing by the multimodal LLM or if it still relies on web scraping for decision-making. They also mention that they've observed the saving of a GIF when `use_vision` is*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file when initializing crew. By setting output_log_file to True or providing a file name and setting save_as_json to True, logs can be saved as an array of JSON events, enabling easy parsing and manipulation. This enhancement simplifies log handling*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the `parse_run_traces` function. This change updates the function to include the last four characters of the run ID of the trace. This modification ensures a unique key for every call.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the validate_samples functionality to include identifying which indexed sample is causing any issues. This enhancement provides more precise information during the validation process, enabling users to pinpoint the specific sample responsible for any errors.*
