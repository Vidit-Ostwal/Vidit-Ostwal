  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior observed may be specific to the particular case due to the variance of the input tensor being close to zero. This condition triggers a warning to highlight potential instability in correlations, leading to incorrect results. They recommend considering input rescaling or using a*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the description of `task 2` to include the necessary dependencies without explicitly setting parameters. Instead, it should indicate that `task 2` utilizes the output from `task 1`. This modification eliminates the error that occurred due to the absence of the `detail` parameter in the `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` function,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updates to the traces functionality to include `{prompt_number} : {trace}`. This will result in traces appearing as a dictionary where each key represents a prompt number and the corresponding value is a dictionary containing the prompt name, input, and output. This new format provides a structured and*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the documentation for CrewAI's memory concept contains errors in its sample code examples. Specifically, the embedder takes input of "model" instead of "model_name." They have provided specific links to the documentation pages where these errors can be found.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format support to the logging file, as the current .txt format is not parsable. This JSON format would enable further analysis and partially address issue #1970. They are willing to contribute a pull request for this implementation.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the purpose of `use_vision set = True` when defining an agent. He questions if the screenshot is processed by the multimodal LLM or if scraping and element-based decision-making are still used. Vidit has observed that the only noticeable difference with `use_vision = True` is the saving*

## üöÄ Pull Requests

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a new feature to save logs as a JSON file. When initializing the crew, users can set `output_log_file` to a file name (e.g., "log.json") and enable `save_as_json` to True. This will create a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, which can be easily parsed*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the parse_run_traces function. The change involves incorporating the last 4 characters of the run_id into the trace, resulting in a unique key for each call. This modification ensures that each call has a distinct identifier.*
