  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a temporary fix using a specific tool. This involves configuring a code interpreter tool with a desired Docker image and adding it to the tools argument in the agents. Vidit-Ostwal is open to providing assistance if there are any doubts regarding the implementation. This approach is intended to resolve the issue at hand until a more permanent solution can be found.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested considering a more controlled approach for integrating the code interpreter tool. Rather than directly utilizing the allow_code_execution argument, he proposes allowing users to configure the tool and add it to the tools argument. He believes that the internal workings of adding tools, whether by the user or by crewai, should not differ significantly. He seeks clarification on whether this adjustment aims to simplify functionality for users and invites further thoughts on the matter.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the crewai version should be bumped and tested again. This is to confirm if the issue has been resolved in the newer versions. The intent behind this suggestion is to ensure that the latest updates might have addressed the problem in question. Testing with the updated version will provide clarity and ensure that any fixes are indeed effective. This proactive approach aims to confirm the functionality of the updates made recently.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is no placeholder named 'input' in the repository, which means that the input is currently not being utilized. This oversight could lead to issues in the implementation. It is essential to have a placeholder named 'input' for the crew to properly use the input data. If there are any misunderstandings or if additional context is needed regarding this requirement, clarification is welcomed to ensure proper functionality.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is a cross dependency issue with embedchain, specifically requiring langchain-openai to be below version 0.3. This indicates that to ensure compatibility and proper functionality, users must be cautious with the versioning of langchain-openai when working with embedchain. Addressing this dependency is essential to avoid potential conflicts and ensure a seamless integration between the two components. Proper version management will help maintain the stability and performance of the application.*
