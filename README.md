  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested several implementation changes are needed, focusing on edge cases related to memory initialization and configuration. Specifically, when `memory = True`, all memory types should initialize, removing the `memory_config` check for user memory. The `UserMemory` class should accept `memory_config` as a parameter, similar to short-term memory's embedder input,*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2255) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Issue while trying to initializing a google ai studio embedder in knowledge (2025-02-28).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested troubleshooting an issue encountered while adapting a knowledge-based CrewAI setup for Google AI Studio.

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case to address issue #2260. The addition focuses on scenarios where the user specifies a single partition in the configuration, alongside setting either `auto.offset.reset` to `latest` or `enable.auto.commit` to `true`. This aims to ensure the application functions correctly under these specific conditions. This enhancement*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on simplifying the user memory configuration within the Crew class. The initial implementation involved multiple checks for `memory_config` and `user_memory`, which were deemed inefficient. The proposed solution streamlines this by directly checking for `memory_config`. The revised logic initializes `self._user_memory` with a*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` command. The problem is that a virtual environment is created that incorrectly considers `crewai_tools` an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed irrespective of whether*
