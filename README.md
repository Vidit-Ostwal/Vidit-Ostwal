  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the team confirms whether the file path in which their crew is running matches the path in the terminal where they are executing the `crewai reset-memories -a` command. This confirmation will help to ensure that the `reset-memories` command is being executed correctly.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool, with parent agents managing the tool. The tool should be capable of initiating a crew, which would then be managed by a parent crew. This multi-layered approach allows for efficient management of crews and their associated tasks.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2095#issuecomment-2651664099) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-02-11.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested considering pre-computed or generalized managers as an alternative. However, @Vidit-Ostwal emphasizes the importance of retaining control over such management, implying that custom solutions may be more suitable in certain scenarios.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the `human_input` function is used after a task is performed to gather feedback on the generated response.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests providing context about agents and tools that the manager LLM can utilize. However, they express concern that adding a "manager_note" specifically for the manager LLM may not be ideal since it is essentially an agent itself. They also recommend allowing users to request that an agent create descriptions,*

## üêõ Issues Raised

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue with running a crew with `human_input` set to True may be due to the fact that the lite llm is not given the user role in the messages when called. To solve this, they have added feedback in the user role. They have also*

- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the code examples provided in the documentation for the Memory concept are incorrect.

- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a feature addition to improve the parsability of the output_log_file. Currently, the file is in .txt format, which makes it difficult for further analysis. The suggestion is to add a JSON format option to the output_log_file, which would address the issue raised in #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal has expressed*
