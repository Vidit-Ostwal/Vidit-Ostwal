Instead, all necessary input should*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests: Including context about the available agents and tools for the manager LLMs is a good idea, but adding a `manager_note` only for that agent may not be suitable. Instead, users could prompt an agent to generate descriptions, goals, and context for the manager agent. This way, managers can*
