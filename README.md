  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that in the list of messages, the system prompt should be removed, keeping only the user and assistant messages. This change aims to streamline the message display by eliminating unnecessary information, thereby enhancing clarity and focus on the interactions that matter most. Implementing this suggestion would help improve user experience by presenting only the relevant parts of the conversation without distractions from the system prompt.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while the current approach exposes all exchanged messages for external memory, a modification is recommended for the Mem0 Storage implementation. Specifically, changes should be made to enhance how messages are processed and stored, ensuring that key message formats reflect a more contextual understanding by incorporating roles such as system, user, and assistant. This adjustment aims to improve the assistant's ability to provide personalized and engaging responses, aligning with the goal of maintaining effective user interactions.*
