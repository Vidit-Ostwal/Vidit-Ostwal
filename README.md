  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the parameters were obtained by enabling debug mode in the system. Additionally, they expressed doubt about the occurrence of any post-processing following this action. This indicates a concern regarding the completeness of the process and suggests a focus on the parameters obtained without additional modifications or enhancements. The emphasis is on the initial debug parameters and their implications for further processing steps in the workflow.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested investigating why the parameter `litellm.drop_params` is not functioning as expected, indicating that it may not be respected. The comment includes screenshots illustrating the parameters passed in two scenarios: one where the user does not explicitly send `drop_params = True` and another where they do. This comparison aims to highlight discrepancies in parameter handling. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal inquires if assistance is needed to patch the issue.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the interaction effectively resolves the flaky test, making it acceptable to merge. However, there's still uncertainty regarding the test's original failure, which stems from unexpected randomness in an otherwise deterministic coding environment. The comment indicates a belief that re-recording the .yaml interaction file could resolve the issue. Additionally, there‚Äôs confusion over the necessity of a specific test for the converter related to a custom LLM model, particularly the llama3_2, despite sharing a similar approach, raising concerns about its relevance.*
