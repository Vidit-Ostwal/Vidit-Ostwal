  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the decision to send messages in the assistant role warrants consideration. A change was made in the save method, but the framework currently records only the agent's replies. There's uncertainty about whether this functionality has been consistent or altered in version 2. Observations indicate some developers manually include user messages for each interaction based on user ID. Additionally, the transition from version 1 to version 2 has impacted the search functionality, replacing simple string queries with more complex filter features.*

- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3217#issuecomment-3117611164) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-07-25.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a plan that includes fixing the addition of memories when an agent ID is provided, emphasizing that it should not be dropped. Additionally, a refactor of the class is recommended to remove support for user IDs, targeting version 0.156.0 or the deadline of August 4, 2025, to eliminate the UserMemory class entirely. These changes aim to streamline functionality and enhance overall system performance, aligning with future development goals and timelines.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3220) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Memory Save / Search Issue (2025-07-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a discussion on the Mem0 Save and Search Issue, noting that User-Memory will be replaced by external memory soon. Currently, messages sent to Mem0 are tagged only as 'assistant' messages and do not include the 'agent_id' parameter. Proposed solutions include restoring 'agent_id' while removing support for 'user_id' until a specified deadline. Additionally, instead of final messages, a list of messages should be sent, and filtering should use an OR block for searches using both 'user_id' and 'agent_id' to improve results.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/issues/3215) in [mem0ai/mem0]: Memory not saving with `infer=False` (2025-07-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while using Mem0 in a project involving CrewAI, there is an issue where memory is not being saved with the setting `infer=False`. The user is questioning if they are making a mistake, as the functionality works correctly with `infer=True`. This highlights a potential bug or misunderstanding in the use of parameters within the Mem0 framework, warranting further investigation or clarification to resolve the memory saving issue.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3225) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Dropping User Memory (2025-07-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested refactoring a specific class by removing the support for user_id. The proposed deadline for this change is version 0.156.0, or by August 4, 2025. This deadline coincides with the removal of the UserMemory class. The aim is to streamline the class's functionality by eliminating outdated support, ensuring better performance and maintainability moving forward. This suggestion focuses on improving the overall code quality by aligning with planned updates and timelines.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3216) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the default value in Mem0 config (2025-07-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the setting `infer=False` is malfunctioning, leading to the default value being automatically set to `True`. This indicates a potential issue with the functionality intended to alter the default behavior. It is important for the development team to investigate this problem to ensure that the expected configuration option operates correctly. Addressing this issue may be critical for user experience or project outcomes, and collaboration may be necessary to resolve it effectively.*
