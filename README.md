  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the ragas version. They also encountered two errors: 1. For the first error, they recommend calling `rel_builder = JaccardSimilarityBuilder(property_name="page_content", new_property_name="entity_jaccard_similarity")` instead of `rel_builder = JaccardSimilarityBuilder(property_name="entities", key_name="PER", new_property_name="entity_jaccard_similarity")` because the sample nodes provided do not have an "entities" property. 2. For the second error, @Vidit-Ostwal believes it's*
