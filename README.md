  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to the implementation, highlighting specific edge cases. Firstly, when `memory = True`, all memory types should be initialized by removing the check on `memory_config` for `user_memory`. Secondly, the UserMemory class should accept `memory_config` as an additional parameter, similar to short-term memory's embedder input, to allow setting*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the usage of `memory_config` to prevent misleading configurations. They propose adding a warning or validation layer to ensure mutual exclusivity. For instance, if the `user_memory` key is present, other keys like `provider` should not be used simultaneously. Vidit-Ostwal has also noted the absence of a test*
