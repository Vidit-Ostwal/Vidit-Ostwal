  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests addressing an issue where only one or two agents can work simultaneously, hindering production request processing. They propose a needed feature to enhance Crew AI's production readiness. Additionally, they express concerns about scaling beyond 10 agents due to potential latency issues. @Vidit-Ostwal offers to collaborate on a PR*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a solution to the issue could be to create an output class for Task 1 with a field called `detail`. The output of one task can be provided as input for another task, and this is a core functionality for agent communication. In 'task2', the description*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the Sequential mode in Crew.ai is essential when the output of one agent is the input for another. Async mode can be used if there is no flow for the entire process. The documentation provides additional details on the different ways to kick off a Crew.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON format option to the output_log_file for enhanced parsability and analysis. The existing format is .txt, which limits its utility. This enhancement partially addresses issue #1970, providing a more flexible and usable logging format. @Vidit-Ostwal expresses willingness to contribute a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding clarifications on the purpose of `use_vision set = True` in agent definitions. They inquired about the involvement of multimodal LLMs in image processing when this parameter is enabled. Additionally, they requested guidance on metrics to assess whether multimodal processing is occurring or not. They observed that*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. When initializing the crew, one can set output_log_file to True or specify a file name, and enable save_as_json by setting it to True. This will generate a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, making it convenient*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the `parse_run_traces` function to include the last four letters of the run ID of the trace. This change would result in a unique key for every call.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the validate_samples functionality to explicitly identify the problematic indexed sample, enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of the validation process.*
