  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool, along with parent agents. The tool should be capable of initiating a crew, which would be managed by a parent crew.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `human_input` should be used after the task execution to provide feedback on the generated response.

This approach ensures that the agent receives all relevant information at the start of*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating context and information about available tools and agents into the Manager LLM. However, they caution against creating a separate `manager_note` field as the Manager LLM is internally similar to other agents. Instead, they propose allowing users to request descriptions, goals, and contexts for the Manager LLM*
