## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the current output logging file has a fixed .txt format, which lacks parsability. To address this, they propose adding a JSON format option to the logging file for better analysis and readability. This enhancement partially resolves an existing issue (#1970). @Vidit-Ostwal expresses willingness to contribute a*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested collecting more information about the use of `use_vision set = True` when defining an agent. They are curious about how it affects the processing of images, specifically whether the screenshots go to the multimodal LLM for parsing or if the entire thing falls back to scraping elements*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs in a JSON file. With this addition, users can enable the save_as_json parameter while initializing the crew to save logs in JSON format.
