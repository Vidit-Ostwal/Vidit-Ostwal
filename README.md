  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while it's a good idea to add context about tools and agents for the manager LLM, having a dedicated `manager_note` might not be ideal since the manager LLM is essentially an agent itself.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the inability to use port 9000 for the application may be due to a security process running on that port. This process cannot be terminated, thus preventing the application from using port 9000.*
