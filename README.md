  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using system exit is not a suitable design choice for production systems, as it complicates integration with larger systems. Instead, implementing an exception mechanism that enables the agent to attempt alternative approaches is more beneficial. Furthermore, he proposes setting the respect_context_window to true, which would allow for functionality to summarize when the context window limitations are exceeded. This approach emphasizes flexibility and better handling of exceptions within system design.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a custom event listener to handle specific events effectively. The proposed implementation defines a class that inherits from a base event listener, which sets up a listener for a particular stream chunk event. This listener is designed to process incoming events by executing a function that prints the event details. Creating a tailored listener enables more precise handling of events within the system, enhancing the software's responsiveness and functionality. This approach fosters better event management practices in the application development.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that assuming `knowledge` is a string should be feasible. Additionally, they proposed bumping the crewai version to verify functionality.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3764#issuecomment-3430765488) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-10-22.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that knowledge in crewai functions similarly to a RAG-based solution, emphasizing the necessity of configuring the right embedding settings. Proper configuration is crucial to optimize its effectiveness. Additionally, the default setting utilizes OpenAI's capabilities, indicating a reliance on their technology for efficiency. Understanding these elements is essential for users to leverage crewai effectively and ensure that their applications are well-informed and responsive to user needs.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the current design choice for sysexit is appropriate, emphasizing the lack of complete context necessary for making further decisions. This remark highlights the importance of having comprehensive information before proceeding with developments or changes.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error message appears when attempting to execute a task with a context parameter set to None. The expected behavior is that the configuration should proceed without issues. The user provided information about the operating system, macOS Sonoma, Python version 3.11, and the latest versions of both crewAI and crewAI Tools, all within a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and a possible solution linked to a previous issue were also included in the comment.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using the described methods, a missing case arises regarding task copying when the context attribute is set to NOT_SPECIFIED. In this scenario, the current structure should make the copied version of the task as None. The comment highlights that there are no steps to reproduce, expected behavior, screenshots, or additional evidence provided. The user is operating on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python version 3.11, utilizing the latest crewAI and tools versions within a virtual environment.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the project approach should focus on enhancing user experience and performance. He emphasized the importance of conducting thorough testing to identify potential issues early in the development cycle. Additionally, he recommended maintaining clear documentation for better collaboration and understanding among team members. Encouraging regular feedback sessions could also foster improvements and innovation in the project. Overall, a collaborative attitude and proactive strategy are essential for achieving project goals effectively.*
