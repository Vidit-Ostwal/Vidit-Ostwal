  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue lies in the configuration of the `input_dict`. When 'inputs' is set, the system attempts to find a key within the `input_dict`. Configuring the `input_dict` with 'inputs' pointing to another dictionary should resolve the problem. Vidit-Ostwal also proposed a functionality within the `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history` function in*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the reason why the Snowflake tool's `_run` method, which is an asynchronous method, may not be awaiting properly. The `_run` method, defined as abstract within the `snowflake_tool`, is invoked by a synchronous `run` method located in the base tool class. This discrepancy between the asynchronous nature of*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested agreeing with the approach of using a single input parameter. The suggestion indicates a preference for this method due to its explicitness, which contributes to clarity and simplicity within the project. The commenter emphasizes the importance of clear and straightforward coding practices, suggesting that a single input*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they are encountering the same problem with the `SnowflakeSearchTool` and that downgrading the tool did not resolve the issue. They are seeking solutions or alternative methods to make the `SnowflakeSearchTool` function correctly. Vidit-Ostwal is inquiring if aybbr is experiencing the same problem that they have encountered.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they were unable to reproduce a specific error, as it worked without issues for them. They believe the problem might stem from the `pyproject.toml` file not being found in the current directory. To further investigate, they requested information on the file and folder structure created after*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested focusing on a conditional task check. The key point is that if a conditional task exists, it must be preceded by a specific task; a crew cannot initiate its operations directly with a conditional task. To verify the existence of a prior, non-conditional task, the code uses*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it is possible to initialize two different class objects. The comment confirms a previous discussion or question regarding object initialization in programming. It essentially affirms the capability to create distinct instances of a class, each with its own unique state and data. This is a fundamental*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that instructions should be configured at the agent level instead of the tool level. They believe instructions and their corresponding tools should reside together. Current agent configurations lack clarity on where these instructions should be placed semantically. When tools are shared among multiple agents, each with distinct*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a solution involving prompt engineering to address the issue. The suggestion involves instructing the agent to produce output in a desired language. This can be achieved by explicitly requesting the output in a specific language or by defining the expected output format at the task level. The*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a refined approach to configuring instructions, proposing that they be implemented at the agent level instead of the tool level. This shift in perspective highlights a potential improvement in the system's architecture. By focusing the configuration at the agent level, there is an opportunity for increased flexibility*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the addition of functionality enabling the incorporation of runtime data from Human through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhancement aims to facilitate a more direct and streamlined data input process. The intention is to further develop this functionality by integrating websockets. This will allow for bidirectional*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case to address issue #2260. This test case aims to verify the functionality and prevent regressions related to the reported problem. The goal is to ensure that the fix implemented for #2260 is robust and reliable. This addition contributes to the overall quality and*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on improving the logic for user memory configuration. The previous code checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. The updated logic simplifies this by primarily checking for `self.memory_config`. Now, if `user_memory` is a `UserMemory` instance, it's directly used. Otherwise, `self._user_memory`*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The process of initiating a virtual environment incorrectly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency in this context. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is installed unconditionally,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the existing work in issue #2422. The focus of the suggestion is to refine the current implementation by removing a specific test case that is deemed unnecessary. This action aims to streamline the testing process and improve the overall efficiency of the codebase. By removing*
