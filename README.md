  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested there might be an issue within the documentation. They propose passing an embedder at the crew level, suggesting this is crucial as knowledge sources internally rely on embedders for storage. They emphasize that the inclusion of an embedder is generally necessary for any knowledge source to function*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential solution. They created a session using `boto3` with AWS credentials and integrated it into the Crew configuration, specifically within the `embedder` settings, to establish a connection. However, they raised a concern about potential redundancy, questioning whether the CrewAI framework inherently creates a session due to*
