  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a modification to the `_install_libraries` function within the Docker container setup. The proposed change involves wrapping the `container.exec_run(["pip", "install", library])` call in a try-except block to handle potential exceptions during library installation, ensuring the process continues even if a specific library fails to install. Furthermore, @Vidit-Ostwal has*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested verifying the presence of `scikit-learn` within the `requirements.txt` file. This is crucial for ensuring that all necessary dependencies are explicitly declared for the project. Including `scikit-learn` in the `requirements.txt` file guarantees that the environment can be consistently reproduced across different machines. A missing dependency can lead to*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a review of the current implementation, specifically regarding error handling. A key concern is how to manage scenarios where execution is successful but returns no data. Vidit-Ostwal wants to determine whether such cases warrant raising an error or simply displaying a warning log. This error handling should*
