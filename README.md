## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an issue in [browser-use/browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407): Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using `use_vision` in the agent definition, it's unclear what happens to the screenshot. They question whether the screenshot is still scraped and used to make decisions or if it goes to the multimodal LLM for parsing. The only difference they've noticed with `use_vision = True`*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a PR in [explodinggradients/ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880): Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the parse_run_traces function should be altered to incorporate the last four characters of the run_id associated with the trace. As a consequence, each call will possess a distinctive key. This modification guarantees the uniqueness of keys for each call, enhancing the overall functionality of the function.*
- Opened a PR in [explodinggradients/ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879): Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the validate_samples functionality to also indicate the specific indexed sample that is causing the issue. This enhancement will provide more detailed information and help identify the root cause of any validation failures.*
