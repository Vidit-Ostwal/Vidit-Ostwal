  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested addressing the problem through prompt engineering. The recommended approach involves instructing the agent to pass an input specifically formatted as `search_query` when utilizing the tool. This adjustment aims to guide the agent in properly interacting with the tool and achieving the desired outcome. The focus is on*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring alternative execution environments for the crew setup. Instead of relying on websockets, they propose directly running the crew setup using either Jupyter Notebook or a standalone Python script. This approach aims to bypass potential complexities or issues introduced by websockets. The suggestion encourages investigating whether a*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that Pamela Fox check if a specific issue has been resolved in the latest version. After creating a new project using the 'crewai create crew Project-name' command, all ruff checks were successful. This indicates a potential fix in the updated version. Therefore, Vidit-Ostwal is prompting a verification*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested gathering more logs to diagnose the installation issue. They were able to successfully install CrewAI and create a new project in a fresh environment using the `crewai create crew <project_name>` command. Therefore, to better understand the problem, they requested the user share the Python version being used.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the behavior observed is primarily due to the use of `try-except` blocks within the `crew-ai` framework. This framework employs `try-except` to facilitate multiple attempts at solving tasks through its agents. The implementation details of this block, responsible for handling potential errors and retrying operations, are crucial*

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the addition of functionality enabling the incorporation of runtime data from Human through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhancement provides a direct method for integrating real-time data. The commenter indicates future plans to broaden this functionality by implementing websocket support. This prospective development would provide persistent*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case to address issue #2260. This test case aims to ensure the correct behavior of a function when handling invalid inputs, specifically testing for expected exceptions. The addition will provide confidence that the code robustly manages edge cases and prevents unexpected errors. The test*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix that simplifies user memory configuration. The original implementation checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, which may have been inefficient. Vidit-Ostwal has proposed to verify only if the `memory_config` is provided with "mem0" as the provider. They also recommended initializing `self._user_memory = Memory()` by*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The issue arises because the virtual environment created by the command treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency, only installing it when a tool is explicitly used.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the existing work in issue #2422. The suggestion indicates that the commenter has made modifications to the codebase by removing an unnecessary test case. The focus of the changes is to refine the existing work by streamlining the test suite. This contribution aims to improve*
