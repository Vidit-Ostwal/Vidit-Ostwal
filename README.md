  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, detailing key logic changes in the `UserMemory` initialization. The prior code checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, but the revised approach simplifies this. Now, it checks if `memory_config` exists and if 'user_memory' is present. If `user_memory` is a `UserMemory` instance,*
