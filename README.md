  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested testing a specific feature branch by running a command to install it directly from GitHub. To revert to the original version, one should uninstall and reinstall the package. This approach shows improved performance with certain models but not with others. Furthermore, there is a request for logs and a clarification on whether the implementation might exceed the context limit. Overall, the feedback emphasizes testing and evaluating performance across different models while seeking additional information for better understanding.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested implementing a specific design choice by passing tool information through the prompt for CrewAI. They have created a demo that includes setting supports_function_calling to true. Based on their experience, this approach generally functions well; however, it seems to encounter issues specifically with GPT-5. Overall, the suggestion emphasizes optimizing user interaction by incorporating tool details within the prompt structure to enhance performance.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to perform a task with the context parameter set to None. The expected behavior is for the configuration to proceed without issues. The issue has been tested on macOS Sonoma using Python version 3.11 and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools, within a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and possible solutions have been provided, referring to a specific issue number for further consideration. Additional context was not provided.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while using specific methods, a scenario is overlooked where the task is copied and the context attribute is set to NOT_SPECIFIED. In this case, the copied version of the task should be represented as None. There are no reproduction steps or expected behaviors provided. The environment details include Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.11, and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools, along with a virtual environment setup. A possible solution is referenced but not elaborated upon.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there are no comments or details to summarize. The absence of any specific content or information limits the ability to provide a meaningful summary. This indicates that there is no actionable insight or context provided in the comment, making it impossible to derive any conclusions or suggestions from it. Overall, the lack of content results in a neutral stance that does not contribute to the discussion. Therefore, there are no key points to highlight or summarize.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3559) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Latest changes are breaking (2025-09-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that recent changes to the crewai may have disrupted previously functional crews. Testing on the main branch has revealed issues when setting up a simple crew. A screenshot documenting the problem is attached, but no specific steps to reproduce or expected behaviors are provided. The testing environment includes macOS Sonoma, Python version 3.11, and the latest crewai version from GitHub, running within a virtual environment. Further details or potential solutions are not shared.*
