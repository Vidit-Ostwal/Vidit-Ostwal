## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a feature to add JSON support in the logging file, which is currently in .txt format. The JSON format will enable further analysis of the logs. This feature partially addresses issue #1970 and @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request for this implementation.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested to clarify the purpose of the `use_vision` parameter in defining an agent. They have observed that setting `use_vision` to `True` only saves a GIF, but the output remains the same. @Vidit-Ostwal has also inquired about the difference in image processing when `use_vision` is set to `True` and*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding the ability to save logs as a JSON file. To enable this, set `output_log_file` to `True` or provide a file name (e.g., `"log.json"`) and set `save_as_json` to `True` when initializing the crew. This will create a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, making it*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a modification to the `parse_run_traces` function. The function now incorporates the last four characters of the `run_id` from the trace into the key. As a result, each function call will have a distinct key. This enhancement ensures unique identification of function calls, addressing a potential issue with*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the validate_samples function to pinpoint the problematic indexed sample that triggers the error. This improvement aims to provide more precise troubleshooting information.*
