  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that directly initializing a `UserMemory()` object is not feasible because `self.memory_config` is initialized to `crew.memory_config`, which would be `None`. The comment highlights specific lines of code to support this observation. The comment also mentions the current state of documentation, indicating that it excludes this particular case. In*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested several changes to enhance the user context handling. Firstly, an early return in `_fetch_user_context` is proposed for optimization. Secondly, to enable user memory functionality, users will need to configure specific parameters such as provider, user ID, and a flag indicating whether to use user memory. The capability*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an update to address issue #2448. The original code logic was modified for efficiency. Vidit-Ostwal suggests simplifying the configuration process for user memory. The initial implementation checked for both 'memory_config' and 'user_memory' within it. The updated logic streamlines this by primarily checking for 'memory_config'. The revised code*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` command. The current implementation creates a virtual environment that mistakenly treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is always installed, irrespective of whether*
