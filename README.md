  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool, along with parent agents. This tool would be capable of initiating a crew and managing it under the supervision of a parent crew.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `human_input` is called after a task to ask the user if the generated response is good. Incorporating additional context while the agent is asking for input may not be ideal. Instead, it's recommended to provide all necessary input during the `crew.kickoff()` function. This approach clarifies the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that including context about agents and tools used by the manager LLM is a good idea. However, they have also expressed concern that adding a unique "manager_note" for one agent may not be optimal. Instead, they propose allowing users to request that an agent generate descriptions, goals,*
