  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to the implementation to cover specific edge cases. Firstly, when `memory = True`, all memory types should be initialized by removing the check on `memory_config` for user memory. Secondly, the UserMemory class should accept `memory_config` as an additional parameter, similar to short-term memory. Thirdly, decoupling is*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to fix issue #2448, focusing on simplifying the user memory configuration within the Crew class. The original code checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` unnecessarily. The revised logic streamlines this by primarily verifying if `memory_config` is provided. If `user_memory` is a valid instance, it's directly used.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew using the `crewai run` CLI command. This process creates a virtual environment that mistakenly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. The proposed solution mandates that `crewai_tools` be installed universally, irrespective of whether tools are*
