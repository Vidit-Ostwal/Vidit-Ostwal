  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior is unique to your specific input tensor. The issue arises when the variance of the `var_x` or `var_y` tensors is close to zero, which can lead to incorrect results. The suggestion is to consider rescaling the input or using a larger dtype for*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an update to the documentation to replace the `model` parameter with `model_name` in the code examples provided. This correction is needed for sample code using Azure OpenAI Embeddings, Google AI Embeddings, Vertex AI Embeddings, and Cohere Embeddings. The complete list of URLs where the correction is needed*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a feature to support JSON format in the output_log_file. Currently, it has a .txt format, which limits its usability for parsing and analysis.
