  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they will address the issue quickly. They have a question about using user_id with run_id, specifically regarding the `memory.reset()` function, which deletes all memory. They are inquiring if there is a way in Mem0 to reset memory for a specific run_id instead of all memory, as the user may want to remove only one particular run_id memory. They noted the absence of documentation regarding this feature in the new version.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue referenced may be a duplicate of an existing ticket, specifically #2850. It implies that the problem described might have already been reported and possibly addressed. Therefore, it may be beneficial to review the details of #2850 to confirm whether the current issue adds new information or context. This can help streamline the tracking and resolution of issues while minimizing redundancy within the project.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested verifying the ability to import a specific module within the UV environment. This involves checking the import functionality of the MySQLLoader from the embedchain.loaders.mysql package. The emphasis is on ensuring that the import process works correctly, which might help in troubleshooting any issues related to module integration. This suggestion aims to facilitate the proper functioning of the code in the designated framework or setup.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the CrewAI memory function utilizes OpenAI's embedding model for processing and storing memories. Even with the DeepSeek API key configured, an OpenAI API key is necessary for accessing the embedding service. This is due to the memory function's reliance on a specialized embedding model to vectorize and store conversational content, which is hardcoded to utilize OpenAI's service. Additionally, for changes to the embedding model, adjustments in configuration are required.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring how various implementation options for attention impact resource usage, recommending the "eager" implementation while noting that other options may require less VRAM. He emphasized modifying the `attn_implementation` parameter when loading the model to apply this setting. Additionally, he expressed interest in finetuning using a specific platform but found its documentation lacking, hindering the process. Feedback on the platform's usability and documentation would be beneficial for users considering it for their projects.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/9) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Finetuning GPU (2025-05-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested appreciation for the open-sourcing of the project and inquired about the resources necessary to fine-tune a Gemma-3 Model. Various platforms have been attempted, including Google Colab T4-GPU and v2-8 TPU, and Kaggle GPUs, but issues with memory and slow performance have arisen. He seeks information on the estimated training time for a full-finetune of the model for a single epoch and requests recommendations for the optimal base configuration to ensure effective training.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/8) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Google COLAB setup issue (2025-05-18).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while setting up a project on Google Colab, an error related to invalid patterns is encountered. The error traces back to a specific line of code within the get_dataloader function, indicating issues with loading the dataset. It seems the code attempts to utilize a glob pattern that is incorrect, as the error message suggests '**' is improperly used. This issue needs to be resolved to successfully load the required dataset for the project.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2854) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added Stop parameter docs (2025-05-17).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating the concept of a stop parameter in the LLM documentation. This addition aims to enhance user understanding and provide clearer guidelines on how to effectively implement this feature. By including the stop parameter, users can gain better control over the output generated by the language model, ensuring that it meets specific requirements and improves overall usability. This proposal seeks to refine the documentation and make it more comprehensive for future users.*
