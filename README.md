  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a simplified approach by modifying the `search` functionality within `user_memory`. The aim is to ensure compatibility with the existing CrewAI codebase, streamlining the integration process. This adjustment involves passing specific parameters to the `search` function, potentially optimizing its performance within the framework. However, Vidit-Ostwal has expressed uncertainty*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that directly initializing a UserMemory object is not feasible due to the initialization of self.memory_config to crew.memory_config, which would result in `None`. The code snippet exemplifies memory configuration with a "mem0" provider, including user ID and API key. The issue arises from how memory configurations are handled*

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on streamlining the user memory configuration for the Crew class. The original code required checking for both `memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. The revised logic simplifies this by directly checking for `memory_config`. If `user_memory` is a `UserMemory` instance, it's used directly.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are used within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. This process creates a virtual environment that mistakenly treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed universally, regardless of*
