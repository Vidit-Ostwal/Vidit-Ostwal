  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a condition to check, emphasizing that a conditional task should always be followed by a specific task, disallowing starting a crew with a conditional task. The code snippet `previous_output = task_outputs[-1] if task_outputs else None` is used to ascertain whether a previous non-conditional task exists. The context*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that initializing two different class objects is definitely possible. This implies agreement with a prior statement or question regarding the feasibility of creating distinct instances from the same class. The comment confirms the basic principle of object-oriented programming, where each object represents a unique instance with its*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that instructions for tool usage should be configured at the agent level rather than the tool level. The reasoning is that instructions and related tools should ideally reside together. Current agent configurations lack clarity on where to place such instructions semantically. The concern arises when multiple agents*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue can be easily resolved through prompt engineering. This involves instructing the agent to generate output in a specific language. Alternatively, setting the expected output at the task level to produce results in a particular language is another viable approach. This method focuses on guiding*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a refinement in the configuration strategy. He believes that the current setup, which applies configurations at the tool level, could be improved. He argues that it would be more effective to configure these instructions at the agent level. This adjustment, in his opinion, would lead to a*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the provided information is useful primarily for local analysis. They noted seeing a post regarding setting up Opik for observability. They pointed out that the CrewAI documentation includes a specific section detailing the setup of Opik as an observability tool, eliminating the need to manually pass*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when initializing the `MDXSearchTool`, it's necessary to pass a `config` parameter. This configuration should be structured as a dictionary, containing specifications for both the language model (`llm`) and the embedder. The `llm` configuration includes the provider (such as "ollama", "google", etc.) and its specific settings like*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested enhancing the documentation for the project. Specifically, there's a need for a clearer explanation of the project structure, including the main modules and their interactions. In addition, guidance should be added on how to contribute effectively, emphasizing coding style, testing procedures, and pull request guidelines. Better documentation*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested initializing language models (LLMs). A tip was provided stating one can initialize a single LLM and assign it to others, which should function correctly. The reason for choosing OpenAI as the default LLM API is because it was among the first and most widely adopted options, which*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that users can define their own Large Language Model and integrate it into the crew using the 'llm' parameter. This enables customization of the language model used within the crew framework. To implement this, users can utilize a specific model like "gemini/gemini-1.5-pro-latest," adjust parameters such as temperature*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the addition of functionality that enables the incorporation of runtime data sourced from Human through the command-line interface. This enhancement allows users to seamlessly integrate real-time information into the system via CLI commands, thereby improving the responsiveness and adaptability of the application. Furthermore, they have outlined plans*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case. This addition ensures that the application behaves as expected under specific conditions. The goal is to maintain consistent functionality and provide a more robust and reliable user experience. The test case focuses on verifying the core logic associated with a specific feature. This*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on simplifying the user memory configuration. The original implementation checked for `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. The proposed change streamlines this by directly verifying `memory_config` for the mem0 provider. The updated code avoids redundant checks for a dictionary and instead initializes*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The core issue arises because the virtual environment created in this scenario treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. Consequently, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the work done in pull request #2422. The focus of this suggestion is to refine and improve the existing codebase by addressing specific elements within it. The primary action taken involves the removal of a test case that was deemed unnecessary or redundant. This removal*
