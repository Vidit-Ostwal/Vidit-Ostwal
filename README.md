  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a small wiki page has been added for those interested in understanding the training process of the tokeniser. He encourages others to review the page and share any unusual findings they may encounter. This initiative aims to facilitate comprehension of how the tokeniser works and to foster discussion among team members regarding its training methods. Insights and feedback from others are welcome to improve understanding and address any concerns.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they have attempted using a single task with two tools, but the agent is behaving unpredictably. They expressed the need for further analysis of the situation by requesting logs. This indicates a concern about resolving potential issues that have arisen from the current setup. The request for logs implies a desire to diagnose the problem effectively and ensure smooth functionality moving forward. Overall, the comment highlights a technical challenge and a proactive approach to troubleshooting.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that although the agent is currently functional with just two tools, a minimum of ten tools per agent may be necessary for practical applications. They emphasized that workflows will struggle to scale without a sufficient number of tools. Furthermore, @Vidit-Ostwal requested assistance in understanding the agent's ability to invoke the appropriate tools correctly and efficiently in a single call. They also proposed testing a task that necessitates combining multiple tools to better evaluate the agent's functionality.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that binding the agent with only two tools has led to expected functionality. However, for practical scenarios, having at least ten tools per agent is necessary for scalability. The current setup may require optimization to meet these needs. The suggestion emphasizes the importance of sufficient tools for operational effectiveness. Additionally, there is a willingness to provide any further details needed to enhance the agent's performance and ensure that workflows can be efficiently scaled.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/pull/29) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Added get_tokenizer_with_new_tokens_func (2025-06-02).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a dynamic function that directly accepts configurations from a configuration file. This function should be responsible for incorporating tokens into the tokenizer, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of the tokenizer's setup process. By utilizing a configuration file, it aims to streamline the implementation, enabling easier adjustments and modifications to the tokenization process. Overall, this approach is expected to improve usability and adapt well to varying requirements during the tokenization phase.*
