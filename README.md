  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior is specific to the input tensor being used, as seen from the custom input they tested. They have identified that the specific condition `(var_x < bound).any() or (var_y < bound).any()` is being hit, which triggers a warning about the variance of predis being*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying task 2 to remove specific parameter initialization. Instead, the description should indicate that task 2 uses the output from task 1. This change would eliminate the error caused by searching for a non-existent "detail" parameter during task 2 initialization.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested investigating the task execution count by setting `output_log_file = True` when defining the crew. This will reveal if the mail sending task is executing twice alone or if other agents are also being called. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal has made a PR (#1985) to enhance log readability by saving*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON support to the output_log_file, which currently only has a .txt format. This change will make the log file more parsable and easier to analyze. Additionally, it will partially address issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute by submitting a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested looking into the `use_vision` parameter when defining an agent. They inquire about its purpose, specifically whether using it causes the screenshot to be processed by the multimodal language model or if it still relies on scraping elements for decision-making. The commenter notes that the only apparent difference*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. When initializing the crew, set output_log_file to True or a file name, and enable save_as_json. This will generate a JSON file with an array of JSON events, facilitating parsing and processing. Example: ``` crew = Crew( agents=[List of*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the parse_run_traces function to include the last 4 letters of the run_id in the trace. This modification ensures a unique key for every call, resolving the issue of duplicate keys in the previous implementation.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested improving the validate_samples functionality to provide specific information about the indexed sample that is causing an issue. This enhancement will increase the precision and help developers identify and resolve issues more efficiently.*
