  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while adding additional context may be helpful, it could also lead to confusion for the LLM. They noted that a similar concept is applied in another context, which can sometimes cause the LLM to hallucinate, producing an input dictionary that includes an irrelevant key. Although providing a description is seen as potentially beneficial, it requires a different approach to avoid misunderstandings and ensure clarity in the output generated by the LLM.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that to view logs in the CLI, setting `verbose=True` at both the agent and crew levels should suffice. Additionally, he believes that incorporating more event listeners would be beneficial for both knowledge and memory aspects. This enhancement could significantly improve the overall functionality and usability of the system. By focusing on these areas, it is anticipated that users will have a more effective experience when interacting with the logs and event listeners.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested setting the verbosity to true at both the crew and agent levels to potentially gain more insight into the errors. This adjustment could help uncover the underlying issues by providing a more detailed error trace. After making this change, it would be beneficial to share the resulting error trace for further analysis and troubleshooting. This approach aims to facilitate a better understanding of the problem at hand and improve the debugging process.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/8) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Google COLAB setup issue (2025-05-18).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they are attempting to set up a project on Google Colab but have encountered a specific error. The problem arises while trying to create a data loader after initializing a processor. The error message indicates that there is a value-related issue involving an invalid pattern that disrupts the dataset loading process. This suggests a deeper issue within the dataset configuration or processing logic, which needs to be addressed for successful execution.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/5) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: [BUG] Cannot access gated repo for url https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-pt/resolve/main/config.json. (2025-05-14).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while attempting to set up a project, an access error was encountered related to a gated repository on Hugging Face. The error indicates that access is restricted, and the user is not authorized despite having an HF_TOKEN in the environment. They are seeking guidance on whether additional configuration is needed to resolve this issue. They express appreciation for the initiative, noting that it would greatly assist newcomers in comprehending these concepts.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2854) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added Stop parameter docs (2025-05-17).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating the concept of a "stop" parameter in the documentation for language models. This addition aims to provide users with more control over the output generated by the models, helping them define specific stopping criteria based on their requirements. By implementing this feature, the documentation can better guide users on effectively utilizing the language models, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience and functionality of the models in various applications.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2831) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fix agent knowledge WIP (2025-05-14).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that to address issue #2806, it is essential to include test cases. This step is crucial to ensure that the code functions as intended and to verify that it meets the required specifications. By implementing these test cases, the integrity and reliability of the changes made will be ensured, ultimately contributing to a more robust and well-tested codebase. This action is necessary for both current and future developments related to this issue.*
