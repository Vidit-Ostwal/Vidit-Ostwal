  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that when attempting to yield a particular value in a generator object, the value needs to be iterated over to use it effectively.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an update to the crew version to potentially resolve the issue mentioned. The suggestion is based on the assumption that the problem may have been previously resolved, and hence recommends checking out pull request #2055 for further details.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2047#issuecomment-2643616523) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-02-07.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests exploring the inclusion of built-in evaluations for CrewAI to assess tool outputs, agent performance, and task results based on predefined criteria such as factual accuracy.

- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2047#issuecomment-2641883649) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-02-07.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested expanding the summarization to support `get_crew` functionality. This would allow CLI commands to directly link with the current crew instance, which was not previously considered. This addition would enhance the capabilities of the summarization feature.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2023#issuecomment-2640720257) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-02-06.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue might be due to discrepancies in how `reset_memory_command` initializes `short_term_memory` and `entity_memory` from the CLI compared to within `crew.py`. While the CLI command works for `long_term_memory` and `knowledge_memory`, which don't need initialization arguments, it may not work for custom initialization of other memory types.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues/5432) in [langfuse/langfuse]: bug: Running Langfuse Locally Dcoker (2025-02-08).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested investigating a bug where the system is unable to set up langfuse via docker docker compose up because the port 9000 used by both clickhouse and minio is already in use by a different system process. Changing the port on the web interface does not fully resolve*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the sample code examples in the documentation at [this link](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/memory) incorrectly use the parameter `model` instead of `model_name` in the embedder input. They recommend replacing `model` with `model_name` in all instances. This would enhance the accuracy and consistency of the code examples.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested enhancing the output_log_file logging feature.

- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the purpose of `use_vision set = True` in defining an agent using Gemini 1.5 Pro is unclear. It is not apparent whether the screenshot is sent to the multimodal LLM for parsing or if the entire image is still processed through traditional scraping and decision-making methods.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. When initializing the crew, users can set `output_log_file` to `True` or provide a file name. They can also enable `save_as_json` by setting it to `True`. This will create a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, facilitating*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a modification to the function parse_run_traces in the issue #1871.
