  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the error indicates the `Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct` model is not compatible with the Hugging Face inference API key. To resolve the issue, it's recommended to try using a different model that is supported. This approach may help avoid the current limitation and ensure smoother functionality. Assessing alternative models could potentially lead to better integration and user experience with the API. Overall, exploring various model options is advisable to overcome this compatibility problem.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while running a specific setup in a Jupyter Notebook, a recursion error occurred due to the `rich` logging system interacting improperly with Jupyter's rendering pipeline. This issue arose when executing tasks with verbose logging enabled. To mitigate this problem, a temporary workaround was implemented by overriding the `rich.Console` to prevent terminal rendering in Jupyter. Following this adjustment, logs displayed correctly without causing recursion issues, allowing for successful execution with verbose output.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the program operates normally when only one tool is used, but encounters an error when multiple tools are present, leading to an empty response. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal attempted to resolve the issue by downgrading the versions of crewai and crewai-tools to 0.119.0, yet this did not resolve the problem, indicating that the issue persists regardless of the version change. This finding highlights a potential limitation or bug when using multiple tools simultaneously.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/9) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Finetuning GPU (2025-05-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested expressing gratitude for the open-sourced project and inquired about the resources required to fine-tune a Gemma-3 Model. They have outlined their attempts with various platforms, including Google Colab and Kaggle, while facing challenges such as insufficient memory and disconnections during runtime. They seek clarification on the estimated training time for a single epoch of full fine-tuning and request recommendations for the appropriate base configuration to use. The comment emphasizes a need for guidance on effectively utilizing training resources.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/8) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Google COLAB setup issue (2025-05-18).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while attempting to set up a project in Google Colab, there is an encountered error regarding a ValueError related to invalid path patterns. The issue arises in a data loading function where the system fails to locate the dataset specified by the given identifier. This indicates there might be a misconfiguration in the dataset path or structure, which prevents the processing of the data from executing correctly. Therefore, troubleshooting the data directory or file format is necessary to resolve this problem.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2893) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed Mem0 Storage v1.1 -> v2 (2025-05-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the Mem0 storage version from v1.1 to v2 for MemoryClient, resolving the associated issue. This change aims to enhance the functionality and performance of the MemoryClient. It's important to ensure that users are informed about the implications of this update. Proper documentation should be provided to facilitate understanding and usage. Additionally, any necessary testing should be conducted to confirm that the new version operates as expected without introducing issues.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2854) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added Stop parameter docs (2025-05-17).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating the use of a stop parameter in the LLM documentation. This addition aims to enhance the functionality and usability of the documentation by providing clearer guidance on effectively stopping the model's output generation. The proposal emphasizes the importance of this parameter in controlling model responses, ensuring users can better manage their interactions with the language model. This enhancement is intended to improve user experience and provide clearer expectations for the model's behavior in practical scenarios.*
