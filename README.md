- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3390#issuecomment-3217132293) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue referenced, identified as #3391, requires fixing. The comment emphasizes the importance of addressing this issue to enhance overall functionality. By resolving this matter, it could lead to improved performance or user experience. The resolution is expected to align with the project's goals and objectives. It is crucial to implement the necessary changes to ensure that the problem is effectively addressed and functionality is restored as desired.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216682728) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the code does not exhibit a scenario where CrewOutput is instantiated without task_outputs. They emphasized that this observation is based on the code review and encouraged seeking confirmation from a maintainer for a second opinion on the matter. It is implied that understanding this aspect of the code is crucial and that validation from someone with authority on the project would provide additional clarity and assurance about the observation made.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216270555) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a specific test case could be skipped, as encountering a situation where CrewOutput is instantiated without task_outputs is unlikely. He finds it confusing that the requirements for creating a CrewOutput object directly differ from those when using the crew.kickoff() method. He believes that handling the potential error for missing TaskOutput should be managed within the CrewOutput class itself, advocating for an additional check to improve error management in this context.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested debugging the issue and requested the project file, including the implementation details of the tools used. This information will help in identifying and resolving the problem more effectively. By sharing these resources, the debugging process can be streamlined, leading to quicker and more accurate solutions. It is essential to have a clear understanding of the project's setup and the tools involved for comprehensive analysis and troubleshooting.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested saving a unique file in the project and requests the relevant embedder to be included. They mention that knowledge sources are chunked and retrieved ultimately. By default, the system utilizes OpenAI models, necessitating an OpenAI key. However, since a different model is being employed, they urge that either the OpenAI key is provided or the appropriate embedder function is set up, indicating the importance of correct configurations for efficient functionality.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3391) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Storage metadata limit breach (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using External Memory with Mem0, save requests may fail if the metadata exceeds 2000 characters. This is caused by the inclusion of assistant messages, user messages, and system prompts in the metadata. To reproduce this issue, one should use external memory and request a response that surpasses the 2000-character limit. The expected behavior is that the process should function without issue. Additional details include the operating system, Python version, and crewAI version used, all of which are up to date.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3390) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Adding user_interaction and agent_interaction directly from messages (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that recent changes include adding user_message and agent_message directly to the message when invoking the save method of Mem0 Storage. Additionally, the messages parameter has been removed from the metadata configuration due to its limitation of 2000 characters. This adjustment aims to streamline the process and enhance the functionality within the existing constraints of the system. Overall, these modifications improve how messages are stored and manage metadata more effectively.*
