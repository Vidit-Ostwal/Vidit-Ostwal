  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they are encountering a problem with the SnowflakeSearchTool and that downgrading did not resolve the issue. They are seeking guidance or alternative solutions to make the SnowflakeSearchTool functional again. They inquired if aybbr is experiencing the same problem with the SnowflakeSearchTool, as they are seeking to*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they were unable to reproduce a specific error, as the program worked fine during their attempt. The issue likely stems from the `pyproject.toml` file not being located in the current directory. To diagnose the problem effectively, @Vidit-Ostwal requests the user to share the file and folder*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a condition needs verification. Specifically, if a conditional task exists, it must be followed by a specific task. A crew cannot initiate with a conditional task. The code snippet `previous_output = task_outputs[-1] if task_outputs else None` is used to ascertain whether a previous non-conditional task occurred.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it is indeed possible to initialize two distinct class objects. The comment confirms the validity of this approach within the programming context being discussed. This affirmation provides clarity and consensus to the ongoing conversation, reinforcing the understanding that multiple instances of a class can be created*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reconfiguring instructions at the agent level instead of the tool level to improve flexibility. They believe instructions and tools should be closely associated. The current agent configurations lack clarity on where to place such instructions semantically. When tools are shared among multiple agents with varying usage scenarios,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue can be easily resolved through prompt engineering. The suggested approach involves instructing the agent to output in a specific language. An alternative method is to define the expected output format at the task level, ensuring that the output is generated in the desired language.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a refinement to the configuration strategy. The current approach seems to apply instructions at the tool level, but Vidit-Ostwal proposes shifting this configuration to the agent level. This adjustment would potentially offer a more suitable and effective method for managing and applying instructions. This proposed alteration may*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the provided information is only helpful for local analysis. A post was seen about setting up Opik as an observability tool. Vidit-Ostwal points out that the documentation contains a specific section detailing how to configure Opik for observability, implying there's a streamlined approach that eliminates the*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when initializing the `MDXSearchTool`, it is essential to pass a `config` parameter. This configuration should be a dictionary. Within this dictionary, specify the Large Language Model (LLM) and embedder configurations. The LLM configuration requires a provider such as "ollama," along with its specific settings like the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested improving the repository's codebase and documentation by addressing several key areas. This includes setting up linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. Furthermore, the suggestion involves writing comprehensive documentation to make the project more understandable and accessible. By implementing these changes, the repository*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a new functionality to the system that allows runtime data from Human to be incorporated via the Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhancement aims to streamline the process of integrating real-time information into the system. Further development is planned to expand this functionality by incorporating WebSockets,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case for issue #2260 to cover scenarios where a specific function is invoked. This test case aims to ensure the function operates correctly with a large number of arguments. The inclusion of this test will help prevent regressions and guarantee the function's reliability under*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on streamlining user memory configuration. The original code checked for both `memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, which was deemed inefficient. The updated logic simplifies this by directly checking for `memory_config`. If `user_memory` is a `UserMemory` instance, it's used directly. Otherwise, a*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are utilized within a crew using the `crewai run` CLI command. This process generates a virtual environment that mistakenly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be consistently installed, irrespective of*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the work done in issue #2422. The primary focus of the suggestion is to refine and improve the existing codebase. This includes the removal of a specific test case deemed unnecessary or redundant for the project's overall testing strategy. The aim is to streamline the*
