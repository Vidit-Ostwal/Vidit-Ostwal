Instead, @Vidit-Ostwal proposes allowing agents to generate descriptions, goals, and context for the manager*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested considering that the problem may be due to the use of `\n`. They recommend replacing it with a `,` or using triple `""` instead of single `""` for the values in the string. They believe this should resolve the issue.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix to the issue. They were unable to understand the initial intention, but they set the `CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable and configured the crew instance and memories to be stored in the directory specified in the `.env` file.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested investigating the port issue encountered during LangFuse setup via Docker Compose.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reviewing the usage of `use_vision = True` when defining an agent.
