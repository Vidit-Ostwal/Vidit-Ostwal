  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a crew within a tool and incorporating parent agents. The tool should be able to initiate a crew managed by a parent crew.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests giving the user more control over pre-computed or generalized managers. While these are valuable options, they believe it is beneficial for the user to have the ability to customize and manage these functions themselves.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `human_input` is called after the task has been performed to collect feedback on the response. He recommends providing all necessary input during the `crew.kickoff()` to avoid interrupting the crew execution flow. He further advises against incorporating additional input context during crew execution.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggested including information about agents or tools that the manager LLM can use. However, they think adding a `manager_note` specifically for the manager LLM might not be ideal since it's internally considered just another agent. Instead, they propose allowing users to request descriptions, goals, and context for the manager*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the underlying cause of this issue could be a security process running on port 9000. This security process is preventing the user from using port 9000, and it cannot be terminated. As a result, the user is unable to complete the task at hand because it*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they have modified the ports for `clickhouse` and `minio` components within the `docker-compose.yml` configuration, but continue to experience the same issue. They have provided an updated code snippet. Additionally, they have mentioned that they suspect the problem might lie within another internal file.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that port 9000 used by ClickHouse and Minio is already occupied by another process, causing the setup of LangFuse via Docker to fail. Changing the port in the configuration does not resolve the issue due to internal references to port 9000 elsewhere in the code. Assistance is*
