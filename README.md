## üí¨ Recent Comments
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3225#issuecomment-3122360852) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-07-26.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that additional code needs to be added to mem0_storage, indicating that this action will take place following the merging of a specific pull request identified as #3217. The comment emphasizes the sequential nature of the tasks, highlighting that the proposed changes to mem0_storage are contingent upon the successful integration of the previous code into the main repository. This suggests a careful approach to code management and integration in the ongoing development process.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3220#issuecomment-3117867007) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-07-25.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the reason for sending messages as the assistant role is related to changes made in the framework's functionality during the transition from version 1 to version 2. The comment notes that previously, both user and assistant messages were processed differently, with only the agent's replies being stored. The new version introduced enhanced search capabilities that replaced simple string queries with more complex filtering options, which has altered how messages are handled and stored in interactions.*

- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3217#issuecomment-3117611164) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-07-25.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a plan to improve the handling of memories by ensuring that the addition of memories remains intact when an agent ID is provided, avoiding its removal. Additionally, the suggestion includes refactoring a specific class by phasing out support for user IDs until a defined deadline, specifically version 0.156.0 or by August 4, 2025, which is set for the removal of the UserMemory class. These changes aim to enhance functionality and streamline the codebase.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3217#issuecomment-3117397218) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-07-25.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an approach to send both user and assistant messages to Mem0. The idea is to compile the list of messages and categorize them based on their roles. This method emphasizes the importance of organizing interactions efficiently, ensuring that relevant context from both users and assistants is conveyed. By doing so, the system can effectively utilize the information, maintaining a coherent flow and enhancing the quality of communication in the overall process.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3220) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Memory Save / Search Issue (2025-07-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested discussing the Mem0 Save and Search Issue, noting that user memory will be replaced by external memory soon. Currently, messages sent to Mem0 are treated as assistant messages, lacking agent_id. Suggested solutions include ensuring agent_id is retained when provided, dropping user_id support temporarily, and adjusting how messages are sent to improve searches. The search should utilize an OR block rather than an AND block when both user_id and agent_id are present to enhance accuracy in filtering search results.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/issues/3215) in [mem0ai/mem0]: Memory not saving with `infer=False` (2025-07-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using Mem0 in a project involving CrewAI, an issue arises where memory is not being saved with the parameter set to infer=False. The commenter is uncertain if they are making an error by only sending the assistant message. However, it is noted that the functionality works correctly when the parameter is set to infer=True. This indicates a potential bug or misunderstanding related to the use of the infer parameter in the system.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3225) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Dropping User Memory (2025-07-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested refactoring the class by removing support for user_id until version 0.156.0, which is scheduled for release on August 4, 2025. This action is necessary as it marks the deadline to eliminate the UserMemory class. The focus is on streamlining the code by making this change, ensuring the project remains up-to-date with its requirements and avoiding any potential issues arising from maintaining outdated components.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3216) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the default value in Mem0 config (2025-07-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the parameter `infer=False` is not functioning as intended, resulting in the default value being set to `True`. This issue raises concerns about the proper configuration of the functionality within the code, which may affect its intended behavior. It is important to address this malfunction to ensure that the parameter works as expected and provides the desired output. Further discussion or resolution may be necessary to rectify this situation effectively.*
