  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested setting `output_log_file=True` when defining the crew to determine if the mail sending task is executing twice or if another agent is being called. They have also made a PR (#1985) to enhance log readability by saving logs in JSON format. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to assist with integrating*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that developing features that don't align with maintainers' vision is futile. They acknowledge that latency becomes a problem when multiple API hits occur, and partially agree with the proposed solution. They believe that latency-solving features will eventually be needed, and the maintainers will have to decide the best*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that due to synchronization constraints, only one or two agents can operate concurrently, preventing the processing of additional production requests until the current tasks are completed. This is considered a key feature for improving Crew AI's readiness for production. Additionally, scaling beyond 10 agents is challenging and*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested providing a code example to aid comprehension. They recommend creating an output class for Task 1 with a "detail" field to facilitate communication between agents by passing task outputs as inputs to subsequent tasks. Currently, an undefined "detail" parameter in 'task2' is causing issues.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested providing the complete code once, as the current description is unclear. This will aid in understanding the intended functionality and implementation of the code.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format to the output_log_file for better parsing and analysis. They believe this change would partially address issue #1970. Vidit is willing to contribute the necessary code changes via a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested to clarify the behavior of the `use_vision` parameter when defining an agent. They inquire if the parameter indicates whether the screenshot is processed by the multimodal LLM or if it falls back to element scraping. @Vidit-Ostwal observes that the only difference with `use_vision` enabled is that a*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a new feature to save logs as a JSON file when initializing the crew. By setting output_log_file to True or providing a file name (e.g., "log.json") and enabling save_as_json to True, a .json file will be generated containing an array of JSON events, enabling easy parsing and*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the `parse_run_traces` function. The function will now include the last 4 letters of the run ID of the trace. This change will result in a unique key for every call, improving the accuracy of the function.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the functionality of validate_samples to include information about the specific indexed sample causing any identified issues. This enhancement will provide more detailed and targeted feedback during sample validation.*
