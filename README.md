  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a logging instance was set to DEBUG for analyzing an error related to a failed LiteLLM call. The error indicates that an existing cassette cannot be overwritten in the current record mode, and no request was matched for a specific API endpoint, despite multiple similar requests being identified. The inconsistency in matching behavior raises concerns about the reliability of the test case, as it intermittently accepts the cassette file. This signifies a potentially flaky aspect of the testing process that requires attention.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that simply changing the model provider will not resolve the issue of flaky tests. It is essential to investigate the underlying cause of the additional requests that are sometimes triggered. Reproducing the issue locally can help identify these extra requests, which serves as a crucial starting point for debugging. This approach will facilitate a better understanding of the problem and help in developing a more effective solution.*
