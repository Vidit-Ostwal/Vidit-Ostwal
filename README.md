  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that CrewAI depends heavily on prompting to generate the final JSON, which can lead to inconsistencies in responses compared to directly configuring the response_format at the LLM level. Additionally, there have been recent concerns regarding the Gemini models not responding in a definitive format, indicating that issues may be affecting the reliability of their output. Proper configuration and handling of responses are crucial for ensuring quality in the final results generated by these models.*
