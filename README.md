  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested testing the feature branch by executing specific installation and uninstallation commands. This process involves installing a particular version of the project and then reverting to the standard version as needed. The update has shown improved performance with certain models, while not functioning optimally with others. Additionally, there is a request for logs to further assess the outcomes, along with an inquiry about whether the changes might exceed the context limit during operation.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to create a task with a context parameter set to None. The expected behavior is to configure the task without any issues. The issue has been noted on macOS Sonoma, using Python 3.11 and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools within a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and a possible solution related to this error have been provided, along with any necessary screenshots or code snippets to support the findings.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is a missing case in the current methods when tasks are copied, specifically when the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED. In this scenario, the copied version of the task should be set to None. There are no reproduction steps, expected behaviors, evidence, or additional context provided. The comment notes the operating system and software versions being used, which include Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.11, but does not include any code or screenshots.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that clear communication is essential for project collaboration. He emphasizes the importance of providing concise documentation and adhering to established coding standards to enhance code quality. Additionally, he recommends regular code reviews to foster knowledge sharing within the team. By implementing these practices, team members can ensure efficient workflows and minimize misunderstandings. He believes that a collaborative environment will ultimately lead to more successful project outcomes and encourages open discussions to facilitate growth and improvement.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3559) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Latest changes are breaking (2025-09-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while testing ideas using crewai, recent changes appear to have disrupted the functionality of previously working crews.
