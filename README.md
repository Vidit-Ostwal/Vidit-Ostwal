  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested highlighting an important observation regarding the instantiation of CrewOutput. They noted that there shouldn't be a situation where CrewOutput is created without task_outputs based on their code review. They advise confirming this observation with a maintainer for verification to ensure accuracy and clarity in understanding the code's behavior.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216270555) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested skipping the specific test case involving CrewOutput instantiation without task_outputs, as this scenario is unlikely to occur. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal pointed out the confusion regarding differing requirements for creating a CrewOutput object directly versus through the crew.kickoff() method. They believe that the validation for TaskOutput should ideally be managed within the CrewOutput class itself to raise appropriate errors, advocating for consistency and improved error handling rather than relying on external checks.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested debugging the issue and requested the sharing of the project file along with the implementation details of the tools being used. This will help in understanding the context and identifying any potential problems within the setup. By having access to the necessary files and implementation specifics, a more effective troubleshooting process can be facilitated, ultimately leading to a resolution of the issue at hand.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested saving a unique file in the project and inquired about the relevant embedder function. They noted that knowledge sources are chunked and retrieved, and that the default models utilize an OpenAI key. Since a different model is being used, they requested either the provision of the OpenAI key or the setup of the relevant embedder function in the project. This highlights an important aspect of integrating models for knowledge retrieval within the project.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3391) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Storage metadata limit breach (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using External Memory with Mem0 can lead to save request failures if the metadata exceeds 2000 characters. This issue arises due to the inclusion of assistant messages, user messages, and system prompts in the metadata. To reproduce the problem, one should request a generated response exceeding 2000 characters. The expected behavior is for the process to function without issues. Relevant operating system details include macOS Sonoma, Python 3.11, and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools. A possible solution has been referenced.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3390) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Adding user_interaction and agent_interaction directly from messages (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that changes have been implemented in the code, specifically by adding user_message and agent_message directly to the message parameter when calling the save method of Mem0 Storage. Additionally, this modification eliminates the messages parameter from the metadata config due to its limitation of 2000 characters. These adjustments aim to enhance the functionality and usability of the system while ensuring compliance with character constraints in metadata configurations.*
