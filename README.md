  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that during initialization, the `config` parameter must be passed. This `config` parameter should be a dictionary containing specifications for both the language model and the embedder. The language model configuration involves specifying the provider, such as "ollama," along with its specific settings like the model name. Similarly,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the current implementation lacks a crucial feature: comprehensive error handling and reporting. They emphasize the necessity of robust error management, advocating for detailed logging to facilitate debugging. They also highlight the importance of gracefully handling exceptions to prevent abrupt program termination. Additionally, they propose implementing mechanisms*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested initializing each language model (LLM). An alternative is to initialize one LLM and assign the others to the same one, which should work. The reasoning behind OpenAI's API as the default LLM choice is its early adoption and widespread use. Other companies prioritize OpenAI compatibility for simpler*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that users can define their own Large Language Model (LLM) and integrate it into the crew by utilizing the 'llm' parameter. This allows for customization of the LLM used within the crew setup. The user provided a way to define an LLM by assigning it to the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential solution involving version upgrades. The user experiencing the issue should attempt to update to a newer version of the software or library they are using. This upgrade may contain fixes or improvements that address the problem. The user should then re-test the functionality to determine*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the problem is related to prompt engineering and proposed a solution to enhance the Large Language Model's understanding of the tool. Vidit-Ostwal is unable to reproduce the error and requested a function replacement with a modified version to improve function description. The suggested function enhances tool*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. During their testing, they encountered no issues when using Gemini. They are curious to know which LLM the user is currently working with, as this information could potentially help in understanding and resolving the problems being experienced.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method to view the prompt sent to the language model (LLM). They note that using verbose mode does not provide sufficient information to see the final prompt. To address this, they implemented a print statement within the `crew_agent_executor.py` file, specifically before the LLM call. This print*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a system prompt for an AI assistant designed to be a People Information Specialist. The assistant's purpose is to analyze questions, utilize tools to search for information about individuals, and then provide concise summaries of its findings. The assistant is instructed to decline questions that are off-topic*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to address issue #2448. The current logic involves several checks for memory configuration and user memory, which can be streamlined. Instead of checking for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, verifying the presence of `memory_config` with "mem0" as the provider would be more efficient. The existing*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The summarization highlights that the virtual environment created in this scenario treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, the summarization explains that the proposed*
