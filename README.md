  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the configuration of the `planning_llm` that resolves the issue. Specifically, they are asking what the `planning_llm` was set to, providing an example using the `openai/sabia-3` model with a specified temperature, base URL, and API key. Additionally, they inquire about the compatibility of the defined LLM with*
