  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the error being raised is because the `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` function is attempting to find a `detail` parameter that is not present. To resolve this, he proposes modifying `task 2` to use the output from `task 1` without specifying the parameter directly. Instead, the description should indicate that*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the documentation for using Azure OpenAI, Google AI, Vertex AI, and Cohere embeddings should be updated to reflect that the embedder takes the input of `model` instead of `model_name`. This is based on the sample code examples provided in the docs.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format to the output_log_file for better parsability and analysis. This JSON format will partially address issue #1970. They are willing to submit a pull request and provide no alternatives.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the purpose of the `use_vision` parameter when defining an agent is unclear. They have observed that setting `use_vision` to `True` only results in the creation of a GIF file and no apparent change in the output. They inquire about any cost metrics available to determine whether*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2031) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixed the memory documentation (2025-02-04).

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. By enabling the save_as_json parameter along with specifying the output_log_file, users can generate a .json file containing an array of JSON events. This simplifies data parsing and manipulation. Here's an example usage: ``` crew = Crew( agents=[List of*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the `parse_run_traces` function to include the last four letters of the `run_id` of the trace. This results in a unique key for every call, making it easier to identify and track individual calls.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
