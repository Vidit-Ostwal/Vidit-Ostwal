  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there won't be any situation where CrewOutput is instantiated without task_outputs. This observation is based on a review of the code, and they recommend confirming this insight with a maintainer for a second opinion. This approach emphasizes the importance of validating assumptions with knowledgeable sources in the codebase, ensuring that the understanding of the instantiation conditions is accurate and aligned with the project's guidelines and design principles.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216270555) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested skipping the specific test case that involves instantiating CrewOutput directly without task_outputs, as it leads to unexpected crashes when accessing the .json property. Additionally, it is noted that the requirements for creating a CrewOutput object directly differ from those when utilizing the crew.kickoff() method. For better handling, it is proposed that errors related to the absence of TaskOutputs should be managed within the CrewOutput class itself, potentially by adding further checks to ensure robustness.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested assistance in debugging the issue and requested the sharing of the project file, along with the specific implementation details of the tools being used. This information is crucial for understanding the context and effectively troubleshooting the problem at hand. Ensuring that all necessary materials are provided will facilitate a more efficient and structured approach to resolving the debugging challenges.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3391) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Storage metadata limit breach (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using External Memory with Mem0, the save request may fail if the metadata exceeds 2000 characters due to the inclusion of assistant messages, user messages, and system prompts. The issue can be reproduced by generating responses longer than 2000 characters. The expected behavior is for the system to function correctly without failures. This issue has been observed on macOS Sonoma with Python version 3.11 and the latest versions of crewAI and crewAI Tools in a virtual environment. A possible solution is referenced in a specific issue.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3390) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Adding user_interaction and agent_interaction directly from messages (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the recent updates involve including user_message and agent_message directly in the message when invoking the save method of Mem0 Storage, rather than adding them to the metadata. Additionally, the messages parameter has been removed from the metadata configuration due to its character limit restriction of 2000 characters. These changes aim to streamline the message handling process and improve the overall functionality of the system.*
