  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a few actions to address the errors encountered. Firstly, they recommend updating the ragas version. Secondly, they have provided a corrected example for defining the relationship builder, which should be `rel_builder = JaccardSimilarityBuilder(property_name="page_content", new_property_name="entity_jaccard_similarity")` instead of using the `key_name` argument. This correction is necessary because the sample*
