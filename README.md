  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is an existing Gradio app for Mukh, named `app.py`, which was designed for an older version. He proposes updating this app to align it with the latest version. Once the app is updated, it can be deployed to Hugging Face for broader access and functionality. The suggestion emphasizes the importance of keeping software updated to enhance performance and usability in deployment environments. Updating will allow users to benefit from the newest features and improvements available.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested creating a simple web interface, potentially using a Streamlit application. The envisioned interface should not be complex but rather straightforward, resembling functionalities found in existing applications like adk-web. This approach aims to streamline the user experience while maintaining ease of use, focusing on accessibility and efficiency in design. The suggestion emphasizes simplicity in functionality to ensure that users can navigate and utilize the application without unnecessary complications.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the two prompts provided are default prompts utilized by CREW AI to enhance the results generated by the language model. These prompts are designed to optimize the interactions and outputs, ensuring a more effective engagement with the system. By leveraging these default options, users can expect improved performance from the AI when generating responses, ultimately leading to more accurate and relevant information being produced for different use cases.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested considering a pluggable system that allows users to choose their preferred file format for saving. The current design choice supports only JSON, which may limit flexibility. It would be beneficial to enable users to select from various formats according to their needs. This approach could enhance usability and adaptability, catering to diverse user preferences. Further context on the design choice can be provided for better understanding of the limitations in the current implementation.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/35) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: `bos_token` used to mask instead of `boi_token` (2025-06-19).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while analyzing the data loader, it seems that using the `boi_token` is necessary for correctly identifying the `image_token_id`. They referenced specific lines of code where this distinction is critical, particularly highlighting a case with a certain model configuration. Additionally, they consulted the official Gemma3 documentation, which also emphasizes the use of `boi_token` during fine-tuning procedures. This insight is aimed at ensuring the data loader functions properly when processing images and associated tokens.*
