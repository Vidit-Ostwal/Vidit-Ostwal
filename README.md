- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/aryagxr/woRLdle/pull/1) in [aryagxr/woRLdle]: Fix requirements.txt and docstring in reward function (2025-08-16).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the project is appreciated and serves as a valuable learning opportunity for implementing reinforcement learning. However, challenges were faced in replicating the setup due to a missing requirements file and unclear regex functionality. To assist others new to the project, it is proposed to add a docstring for better clarity. Feedback is welcomed on specific areas that may require modification, demonstrating a collaborative approach to improve the project‚Äôs documentation and accessibility for new learners.*
