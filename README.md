  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarification on the processing time related to the model string and agent role string. It appears that the processing does not occur while the crew is being initiated. The comment acknowledges a misunderstanding and accepts responsibility for the error. This insight emphasizes the importance of focusing on specific elements within the workflow without overlooking critical components that might affect the operation's timing. The input highlights the need for clear communication regarding the system's functioning.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the transition from the old User Memory system to a unified External Memory interface simplifies configuration and enhances flexibility for future storage providers. The External Memory supports `Mem0` and any customer storage. Users must update their code to utilize the new external_memory setup. Additionally, External Memory accommodates both Mem0 OSS and Mem0 Client, streamlining integration for users and developers moving forward. It encourages adaptation to maximize the benefits offered by this new feature.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the performance metrics presented are impressive, especially noting the enhancements in string operations. Additionally, there is a request for sharing the methodology used to collect these metrics. The inquiry implies a desire to understand the approaches taken to achieve these results, indicating an interest in replicating or learning from the methods applied. Overall, the emphasis is on appreciating the performance improvements while seeking further clarification on the evaluation process utilized.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issues regarding the embedder configuration should be addressed in future pull requests rather than the current one. They assert that the embedder configuration at the crew level and the external memory configuration operate independently of each other. Thus, changes made at the crew level do not impact the external memory settings. Additionally, they have successfully initialized a crew object without any complications and are open to any feedback or corrections regarding their understanding.*
