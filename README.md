  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that he is working on understanding the 'nanovlm' creation and the associated calculations. He is planning to add a draft pull request by the end of the day to facilitate collaboration. He expresses appreciation for the offer of assistance regarding benchmarking memory and indicates that while the current focus is on vanilla torch iterations without dynamic kernel patching, he is open to exploring other options, like using unsloth.ai, if someone proposes testing and integrating that into the repository.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using a specific method to transfer batch data to model devices should not be problematic, as the batch originates from a DataLoader with a custom collate function. However, this batch is likely to be a complex data structure rather than a simple tensor, since the method to transfer data exists only for PyTorch tensors. To prevent potential errors, creating a helper function could be beneficial, as it would better handle the complexities of such data.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested appreciation for the pull request and requested to see some training results. They are currently working on this but are facing challenges due to not having the appropriate GPU size. To address this issue, @Vidit-Ostwal is attempting to incorporate the accelerate library into their process to facilitate the training efforts. This indicates an ongoing commitment to improve performance and share progress as soon as possible.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/19) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Add location tokens to tokenizer and train the embedding (2025-05-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a need for clarification regarding a specific idea, expressing uncertainty about the requirements of a project. As someone new to the topic, the commenter seeks a basic understanding and requests surface-level ideas to help grasp the core concepts involved. This indicates a desire for guidance to better comprehend the expectations and directions necessary to proceed with the task at hand. A succinct explanation would be beneficial for someone unfamiliar with the project details.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/15) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Error configuring (2025-05-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a `train_dataloader` to the existing file system. The implementation involves fetching a training dataset and building a data loader using specific parameters. However, an error occurs during execution, indicating a `ValueError`. This error implies that the dataset cannot be loaded due to an invalid pattern in the file path, which is not correctly defined. The existing code snippets illustrate where the issue arises in the dataset loading process, highlighting the need for reevaluation of the file path configurations.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/pull/13) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Add QLoRA support file WIP (2025-05-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the current pull request is aimed at adding support for training with QLoRA. However, it is important to note that the work on this feature is still a work in progress. This addition is expected to enhance the training capabilities in the relevant context. Further updates and improvements will follow as the implementation progresses, indicating a commitment to refining this functionality within the project.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2893) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed Mem0 Storage v1.1 -> v2 (2025-05-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the pull request updates the Mem0 storage version from v1.1 to v2 for MemoryClient, addressing issue #2776. This change aims to improve functionality and performance in alignment with newer standards. It‚Äôs essential to ensure that all related documentation is reviewed to support the transition effectively, although specific references are not included in the summary. This update is pivotal for maintaining efficient memory management within the project.*
