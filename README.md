  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring alternative data structures to improve the efficiency of managing and processing product information. He proposes considering using a trie data structure for storing and retrieving product names due to its efficient prefix-based search capabilities. This could significantly reduce search times compared to existing methods. Additionally, he*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested initializing each language model (LLM), noting that initializing one and assigning it to others could be a viable approach. Addressing the query about OpenAI being the default LLM, Vidit-Ostwal posited that its early adoption and widespread compatibility made it a standard choice. APIs from companies like DeepSeek*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested defining a custom LLM and incorporating it into a crew via the 'llm' parameter. This approach allows for flexibility in choosing and configuring the desired language model for specific tasks within the crew. An example shows how to define an LLM, specifying model details such as its*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a solution related to prompt engineering, hypothesizing that providing the LLM with more detailed information about the tool might resolve the problem. A specific code modification is proposed, focusing on enhancing the information provided about how the function operates. The suggested change involves replacing a particular function*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. They share that they attempted a similar task with Gemini, and did not encounter any issues. The comment aims to identify potential discrepancies or limitations related to the particular LLM in use. By understanding the model being*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a way to view the final prompt sent to the language model (LLM). Observing that the `verbose` setting doesn't provide sufficient information, they propose directly printing the prompt before the LLM call to enable visibility. The user highlights a specific section of code where they added a*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a prompt for an AI assistant designed to be a People Information Specialist. This assistant focuses on finding and summarizing information about individuals using specific tools. The prompt emphasizes the importance of analyzing user questions to determine if they are about a person. If so, the assistant*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential fragility in the current approach. The core concern revolves around the system's vulnerability to changes in the structure of the nested dictionary generated by the `llm`. Specifically, if the `llm` were to produce a dictionary with different keys or a modified nested structure, the existing*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the addition of a new feature that allows users to incorporate runtime data from Human directly through the Command Line Interface. This enhancement enables real-time data integration, enhancing the system's overall capabilities and responsiveness. The feature currently resolves issue number 223. Further expanding on this initial implementation,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case to address issue #2260. The test case aims to verify the functionality and correctness of a particular aspect related to the identified problem. The goal is to ensure that the implemented solution behaves as expected and effectively resolves the issue. By including this*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, detailing key logic changes to the user memory configuration. The previous code required checks for both `memory_config` and `user_memory` and handled different types of `user_memory_config`. The proposed logic simplifies this by checking only for `memory_config`. If `user_memory` is a `UserMemory` instance, it's*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when utilizing tools within a crew via the `crewai run` command. The process creates a virtual environment that erroneously considers `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be consistently installed, irrespective of*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the existing work in issue #2422. The primary focus of this suggestion involves refining the current scope by eliminating an unnecessary test case.
