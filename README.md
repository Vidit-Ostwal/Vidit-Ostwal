  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior in the code may be due to a specific condition where the variance of predis (var_x) or target (var_y) is close to zero. This causes instability in Pearson's correlation and leads to incorrect results. To resolve this, consider rescaling the input or using*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the error in `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` function is because it tries to find the `detail` parameter which is not present. To fix this, the `task2` description should be updated to use the output from `task1` without specifying the parameters. Instead, it should mention that `task2` takes the `detail` parameter*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested enhancing the flow for improved user understanding. They believe the modification would be straightforward to implement and seek @jjmachan's approval to continue. If authorized, @Vidit-Ostwal will update the PR to reflect these changes.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON format option to the output_log_file, which currently uses a .txt format. This change would make the log file parsable and easier to analyze, partially addressing issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request to implement this feature.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring the use of the `use_vision` parameter when defining an agent. They inquire about its functionality, particularly whether it triggers multimodal processing of images by the LLM or if it simply falls back to element scraping. Additionally, they seek a cost metric to determine if multimodal image*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a feature to save logs as a JSON file. This is supported by setting output_log_file to True or providing a file name and setting save_as_json to True. The resulting JSON file will contain an array of JSON events, simplifying parsing and manipulation.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the parse_run_traces function to include the last 4 letters of the run_id of the trace. This change will result in a unique key for every call, which will be beneficial for tracking and identifying calls.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the validate_samples functionality to provide information about the specific indexed sample causing any issues encountered during the validation process. This enhancement will enable more precise troubleshooting and error resolution.*
