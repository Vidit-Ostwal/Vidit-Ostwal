- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3390#issuecomment-3217132293) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for an issue referenced as #3391. The solution aims to address the underlying problem effectively, ensuring that the concerns raised are resolved satisfactorily. This action is expected to improve the overall performance and functionality of the project, contributing to a better user experience. By implementing this fix, it is anticipated that future complications related to the issue will be mitigated, thereby enhancing the reliability of the system in question.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216682728) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there should not be any instances where CrewOutput is created without task_outputs. This observation is based on a review of the code, indicating a consistent dependency on task_outputs during instantiation. To ensure clarity and accuracy, it is recommended to confirm this observation with a maintainer to obtain a second opinion. This suggestion aims to enhance understanding and maintain code integrity.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216270555) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested skipping the specific test case involving the instantiation of CrewOutput without task_outputs, as such scenarios are unlikely. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal expressed confusion regarding the differing requirements for creating a CrewOutput object directly compared to through the crew.kickoff() method. He proposed that this inconsistency should be addressed within the CrewOutput class by adding an error check for cases with no TaskOutput, suggesting that it would enhance clarity and robustness in the code handling.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that assistance could be provided in debugging the issue. To proceed effectively, it is requested to share the project file along with the specific implementation of the tools being used. This will enhance the understanding of the problem and facilitate a more efficient debugging process. The collaboration aims to identify and resolve the issue at hand, ensuring that all relevant details are available for a thorough examination.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested storing a unique file in the project while also highlighting the need for an appropriate embedder. It is noted that knowledge sources are chunked and retrieved, relying on default models that necessitate an OpenAI key. Alternatively, if a different model is being utilized, it is crucial to either provide the required OpenAI key or implement the necessary embedder function within the project. This will ensure proper functionality and integration of knowledge embedding.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3391) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Storage metadata limit breach (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using External Memory with Mem0, save requests may fail if the metadata exceeds 2000 characters. This issue arises due to the inclusion of the assistant message, user message, and system prompt in the metadata. The expected behavior is for the functionality to operate without problems. The suggestion outlines steps to reproduce the issue and mentions the macOS Sonoma operating system, Python 3.11, and the latest versions of crewAI and crewAI Tools. A possible solution reference is noted.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3390) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Adding user_interaction and agent_interaction directly from messages (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to the implementation by integrating the user_message and agent_message directly into the message during the Mem0 Storage save method call. This modification replaces the previously included messages parameter in the metadata configuration, which was limited to 2000 characters. These adjustments aim to streamline message handling and improve efficiency within the storage process, ensuring that important data is retained while adhering to the constraints of the metadata configuration.*
