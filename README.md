  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is limited information on a flaky test case previously mentioned. They have registered a new interaction with llama_2 for testing, noting the primary difference is using an external provider instead of local support. They believe this change should not introduce any issues but are open to feedback if they are overlooking something.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2765#issuecomment-2872910242) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-05-12.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reviewing a specific commit that demonstrates a significant change in the implementation. The key difference is the utilization of the `open-router` API key rather than using a local version of llama. This adjustment highlights a shift towards leveraging external resources for improved functionality in the project. It is important to examine the implications of this change for the overall performance and integration within the existing system.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the reported issue may stem from a flaky test. The recent PR addressed the test by utilizing proper mocking techniques, but there might still be underlying changes causing abnormal behavior. It is crucial to reliably reproduce the flaky behavior to identify and resolve the underlying issue effectively. Additionally, after conducting continuous testing with successful outcomes, the suggestion is made to potentially add the new interaction in a separate PR for further enhancement.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that instead of fixing everything simultaneously, which could result in numerous conflicts with existing pull requests, it is more effective to apply linter checks solely to the files that have been modified. This approach aims to minimize disruption and streamline the integration of changes while ensuring code quality. By focusing on changed files, the team can maintain a balance between addressing issues and preventing excessive conflicts during the development process.*
