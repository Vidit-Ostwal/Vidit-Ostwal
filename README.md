  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the observations may stem from a small dataset consisting of 6,000 images with only one object per image, combined with the introduction of a significant number of new tokens in the second pipeline, around 1,000. This increase in tokens likely necessitates more training data to learn effectively. They are inquiring whether increasing the number of training epochs could potentially address these issues and improve the learning process.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the commenter seeks evidence or references that demonstrate the effectiveness of type checkers. They express confusion regarding the need for such evidence, noting that type checking is a common practice in programming. The comment indicates a belief that type checkers are generally accepted without the necessity of specific proof of their advantages. Overall, the commenter questions whether they are overlooking something significant in the discussion about type checking practices.*

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/pull/32) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Added functionality to measure VRAM (2025-06-16).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the addition of the `measure_vram.py` file, which includes a separate function for model initialization. This change allows users to easily modify the model setup when experimenting with different configurations, including LORA and full fine-tuning. The separation of concerns in the code enhances flexibility, making it easier for others to adapt the model for their specific training needs. This structure aims to streamline the process for users looking to customize their fine-tuning approaches effectively.*
