  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an alternative approach to address the issue of running CrewAI asynchronously with multiple inputs. Based on the code, the user seems to be attempting to execute CrewAI in an asynchronous manner with several inputs. Vidit-Ostwal recommends exploring the `kickoff_for_each_async()` method provided by CrewAI, believing it could offer*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue arises from how CrewAI handles custom embeddings when an embedder is provided within the crew. CrewAI manages this internally. However, the tools being used rely on Embedchain, which powers the RAG tool. Embedchain doesn't appear to support custom models, leading to the encountered problem.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue might stem from ChromaDB's behavior of locking a collection to the dimensionality of the first added embeddings. After initial collection creation, it adapts to the dimensionality of the first batch of embeddings. Subsequent additions or queries must then adhere to this established dimensionality, which*
