  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool, where parent agents can manage the crew. The tool should be designed to initiate and manage crews efficiently, allowing for a hierarchical structure where crews operate under the supervision of parent crews.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the usage of `human_input`. He explains that `human_input` is called after a task is performed to gather feedback on the generated response.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it is a good idea to include context about the agents or tools that the manager LLM can use. However, they have also expressed concern that adding a `manager_note` just for one agent may not be the best approach since the manager LLM is essentially an*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the sample code examples in the CrewAI documentation for Azure OpenAI Embeddings, Google AI Embeddings, Vertex AI Embeddings, and Cohere Embeddings incorrectly use "model" as the input parameter for the embedder instead of "model_name".
