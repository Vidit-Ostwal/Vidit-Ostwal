  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested setting `output_log_file` to `True` to determine if the mail sending task is executing twice or if other agents are also involved. They have also made a PR to enhance log readability by saving logs in JSON format (#1985). @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to assist with integrating these changes*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it's unwise to develop features that don't align with the maintainers' vision. He's currently experiencing latency issues with multiple API hits and believes that latency-solving features will be necessary in the future. The specific approach (e.g., Kafka) to address this issue is up to the maintainers.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that only a maximum of one or two agents can work simultaneously, preventing the processing of additional requests from production until the current tasks are completed. Scaling beyond ten agents is seen as challenging due to potential latency issues. They have expressed interest in collaborating on a*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it would be helpful if @chenk-gd could provide their code. They also recommend creating an output class for Task 1 with a field called "detail," as this would facilitate task communication by providing a defined parameter for the "detail" field in Task 2's description.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON formatting to the output log file. Currently, the output_log_file is in .txt format, which is not easily parsable. JSON would enable further analysis and partially address issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request to implement this feature.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring the usage of `use_vision set = True` while defining an agent. This parameter enables the multimodal LLM to process images. They have observed that it generates a .gif file, but the output otherwise remains the same. However, they are not able to determine if the image*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. When initializing the crew, one can set the output_log_file to True or provide a file name and enable save_as_json by setting it to True. This will create a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, making it*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the `parse_run_traces` function to include the last four letters of the `run_id` of the trace. This modification ensures that every call has a unique key, thereby enhancing identification and traceability.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the `validate_samples` function to identify the indexed sample causing any issues during validation. This enhancement will provide more granular information about the problematic sample, facilitating easier debugging and troubleshooting.*
