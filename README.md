  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested utilizing event listeners to improve the functionality. This approach may help to achieve a better integration of logs alongside the final results, addressing the need for these logs for agent evaluation, rather than having them strictly at the terminal level. Implementing event listeners could facilitate easier access to the desired information, enhancing tracking and assessment processes. This suggestion aims to streamline operations and improve user experience within the project, ensuring that critical data is readily available when needed.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested setting the verbose option to true for both the agents and the crew level. This adjustment may enhance the clarity and detail of the outputs generated, potentially aiding in better understanding and troubleshooting. Implementing this change could lead to more informative logs and improved overall performance in monitoring the system's operations. The suggested setting aims to ensure that all relevant information is captured and displayed effectively during the execution of tasks.*
