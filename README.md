## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the CrewAI documentation for memory concepts is incorrect. In the sample code examples provided, the `embedder` takes the input of `model` instead of `model_name`, as stated in the docs. This issue is present in multiple sections of the documentation, including those for Azure OpenAI, Google AI,*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON format to the logging file for better parsability. This would also partially address issue #1970. They have expressed willingness to contribute by submitting a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested providing more information about the `use_vision` flag when defining an agent. They have noted that when `use_vision` is set to True, a .gif is saved, but the output remains the same. They have questioned whether setting `use_vision` to True triggers multimodal processing of images and if there*
