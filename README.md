  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring event listeners, indicating that their usage might eliminate the need for the current pull request to be merged. He believes that understanding these listeners will provide better functionality for the project. He also highlighted a specific event, the LLMStreamChunkEvent, which could be relevant to their discussion. Overall, the focus is on leveraging existing features to streamline the development process rather than relying on the proposed changes in the PR.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that he is uncertain about the issue but has successfully executed a straightforward operation, which indicates that it functions without any problems. His comment reflects a positive experience with the task he attempted.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3708#issuecomment-3426900160) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-10-21.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the design choice of CrewAI involves passing tool information via the prompt, which has generally performed well except on GPT-5. He identified an issue where setting supports_function_calling to true in his custom model did not override its configuration in LiteLLM, resulting in it remaining false. To resolve this, he recommends overriding the call method in the custom LLM and suggests that parameters can also be set through an environment variable when using LiteLLM.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the version and performing a verification check thereafter. This action implies a need to ensure that the latest changes or improvements are properly integrated and functioning as expected. By bumping the version, any subsequent issues can be more easily identified, and this step can help maintain organized version control. Overall, the suggestion emphasizes the importance of continual testing and validation within the development process after implementing updates.*
