  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested trying a specific configuration for the MDXSearchTool. This configuration includes an embedding model from OpenAI and a choice between two vector database providers, Chroma or Qdrant. Important configuration details about the embedding model and vector database setup were mentioned, although some specific code elements were omitted. The recommendation aims to enhance the tooling setup for better performance or functionality without direct reference to external documentation.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/477#issuecomment-3454427397) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools] on 2025-10-28.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested closing the discussion as crewaiai-tools is no longer functioning as an independent library. This indicates a shift in the library's status, likely integrating with another project or undergoing significant changes that affect its standalone capabilities. Therefore, it is no longer relevant to continue the conversation regarding its independent status. This decision reflects an understanding of the library's current situation and acknowledges the need to move on from previous discussions.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that feedback is welcome regarding the current example. If there is agreement on the opinion shared, a quick pull request will be opened to remove the existing example. This indicates a willingness to make changes based on collective feedback, highlighting the importance of collaboration in the development process. The approach shows readiness to enhance the project based on team consensus, ensuring the example aligns with community expectations and standards.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the library currently lacks stability, which is preventing successful implementation. Despite testing several versions, including .0.3.0, .0.3.1, .0.3.4, .0.3.5, and .0.3.7, none have proven to be stable enough to continue without encountering errors. The absence of a stable version indicates that further improvements are needed before the library can be reliably used in practical applications. This feedback highlights the necessity for enhanced stability in the upcoming releases.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to create a task with the context parameter set to None. The expected behavior is that the configuration should complete without issues. Relevant details about the environment include operating system macOS Sonoma, Python version 3.11, and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools alongside a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and possible solutions have been provided, referencing an issue noted in the context of the problem. Screenshots have also been included for clarity.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using the specified methods, there is an oversight when tasks are copied, particularly when the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED. In such cases, the copied version of the task should be set to None. No additional steps to reproduce or expected behavior were provided. The issue occurs on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python version 3.11 and the latest crewAI versions. There is a possible solution referenced in a GitHub pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
