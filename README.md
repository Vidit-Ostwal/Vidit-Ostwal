  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating crews within a tool, managed by parent crews. These parent crews would be capable of initiating the crews within the tool, offering a hierarchical structure for managing crew operations.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `human_input` is called after a task is performed and asks users whether the response is good or not. They believe that incorporating additional context while the agent is asking for user input may not be the best idea. Instead, they recommend providing all necessary input while*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested including context, as well as information about the agents and tools that the manager LLM can use, in the manager LLM guidelines. However, they have raised a concern that since the manager LLM is internally just another agent, adding a special `manager_note` just for it may not*

The logs show the Redis server starting, PostgreSQL listening on ports 5432, and ClickHouse starting. However, applying ClickHouse migrations failed due to the database being unavailable. The logs also show MinIO, LangFuse, and*
