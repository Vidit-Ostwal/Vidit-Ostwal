  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested checking the `requirements.txt` file to confirm the presence of `scikit-learn`. The inclusion of `scikit-learn` as a dependency ensures that the necessary machine learning library is readily available for the project. This step is crucial for avoiding potential import errors or missing dependency issues during execution. Verifying its*
