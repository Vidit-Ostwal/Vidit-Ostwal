  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue might stem from ChromaDB's dimension locking behavior. When a collection is initially created, it accepts vectors of any dimensionality. However, after the first batch of embeddings is added, the collection locks to that specific dimensionality. Subsequent operations must then use embeddings of the same*
