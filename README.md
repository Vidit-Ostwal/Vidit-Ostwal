  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested setting `output_log_file = True` when defining the crew to determine if the mail sending task is executing twice alone or if any other agent is being called. They have also made a pull request (#1985) to enhance the readability of the logs by saving them in JSON*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that it is pointless to develop features that do not align with maintainers' visions. They encounter latency issues with multiple API hits and believe that resolving such issues is inevitable. They acknowledge the proposed solution partially addresses their problem and anticipate that maintainers will need to address latency*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that only one or two agents can work simultaneously, preventing processing further requests from production until the ongoing task is complete. This limits scaling beyond 10 agents due to potential latency issues. They have expressed interest in contributing to a potential PR for this feature, citing their*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the following:

- Provide a code sample to improve clarity.
- Create an output class for Task 1 with a "detail" field to pass data to subsequent tasks.
- Define the "detail" parameter in 'task2' to resolve the current issue.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested sharing the entire codebase as the current description is challenging to understand. The suggestion is to provide a more comprehensive view of the code's structure and functionality.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON as an alternative format for the output_log_file. The current .txt format is not easily parsable, and JSON would support further analysis capabilities. This would also partially address issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using the `use_vision` parameter in an agent definition, it is unclear what the impact is on the agent's behavior. Specifically, it is not clear whether the agent will still rely on scraping elements and making decisions based on that, or if it will use the*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a feature to save logs as a JSON file. This is accomplished by setting output_log_file to True or a file name and save_as_json to True when initializing Crew. The resulting .json file will contain an array of JSON events for easy parsing and use.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the #1871 function: parse_run_traces. The change includes the last 4 letters of the run_id of the trace, resulting in a unique key for each call. This modification ensures that every call has a distinct identifier, enhancing the overall accuracy and reliability of the function.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the validate_samples functionality, which now provides information about the specific indexed sample causing any issues encountered during validation. This enhancement improves the diagnostic capabilities of the functionality, allowing for more targeted troubleshooting and resolution of any sample-related problems.*
