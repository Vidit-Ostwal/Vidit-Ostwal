  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool and some parent agents, with the tool having the capability to initiate a crew managed by a parent crew. This approach would involve nesting crews and agents in a hierarchical structure, allowing for more complex and structured agent-based simulations.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there may be a misunderstanding regarding the function of `human_input`. `human_input` is designed to prompt the user for feedback on the generated response after the task has been completed, asking the user to evaluate the response's quality. Incorporating additional context during the agent's request for input*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests including context about agents and tools available to the manager LLM. However, they note the concern that adding a `manager_note` specifically for the manager LLM may not be ideal since it's an agent like any other internally. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal proposes exploring the possibility of having agents generate descriptions,*
