  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested altering the implementation to address specific edge cases related to memory initialization and configuration. It's crucial to initialize all memory components when `memory = True`. The UserMemory class should accept `memory_config` to enable user memory configuration without requiring crew settings initially. Decoupling is needed when short-term memory*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a straightforward method for incorporating changes into a user's local version of a library. The proposed approach involves directly copying the modifications from the relevant branch into the user's library. Following this, @Vidit-Ostwal recommends restarting the kernel to ensure that the updated changes are properly loaded and*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a warning or validation layer to prevent misleading usage of `memory_config`, specifically ensuring mutual exclusivity. If the `user_memory` key is present, other keys like `provider` should not be used together. Vidit-Ostwal highlights the absence of a test case covering the usage where `crew = MockCrew(memory_config={'user_memory': UserMemory()})`*

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to fix issue #2448 by modifying the logic for initializing `self._user_memory`. The original code checked for `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, but the updated logic simplifies this by only checking for `self.memory_config`. If `user_memory` is an instance of `UserMemory`, it's used directly. Otherwise, `self._user_memory` is initialized*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` command. The current implementation creates a virtual environment that treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed universally. This ensures that the necessary*
