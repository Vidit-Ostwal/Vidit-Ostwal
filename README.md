  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the method of user input retrieval. The commenter indicated they are not utilizing 'human_input.' Instead, a custom tool is employed where questions are transmitted via websocket, and the system awaits the user's response through the same channel. The commenter confirms that a websocket is the mechanism*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the behavior observed is primarily due to the use of a `try-except` block within the `crew-ai` framework. This block is utilized because `crew-ai` has a built-in functionality to make multiple attempts to solve tasks assigned to agents. This mechanism allows the system to handle potential errors*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260. This addition aims to ensure the correct behavior of a specific feature, contributing to the overall reliability of the system. The test case verifies a particular scenario, helping to prevent regressions and ensure that the implemented solution functions as*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on streamlining the user memory configuration. The original code involved multiple checks for `memory_config` and `user_memory`. The proposed solution simplifies this by primarily verifying `memory_config` presence. If `user_memory` is an instance of `UserMemory`, it's directly assigned. Otherwise, `UserMemory` is initialized with*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are used within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. This process creates a virtual environment that mistakenly treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed universally, irrespective of*
