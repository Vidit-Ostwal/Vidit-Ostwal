  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested utilizing event listeners as a potential solution to enhance logging capabilities. This approach aims to make logs more accessible by integrating them with the final results, thus facilitating better agent evaluation. The emphasis is on improving the visibility of logs, currently restricted to the terminal level, and incorporating them into a more comprehensive format that allows for their use alongside the final output. This recommendation seeks to improve the overall utility and effectiveness of log management in the project.*
