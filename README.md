  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested using event listeners to address the issue at hand. This approach can provide enhanced functionality for managing logs, making them easily accessible alongside the final results. Consequently, this will enable better agent evaluation by ensuring that essential information is readily available beyond just the terminal level. Leveraging event listeners can significantly improve the overall process, optimizing how data is presented and utilized for the intended purpose. This method aims to streamline workflows and enhance visibility in the application.*
