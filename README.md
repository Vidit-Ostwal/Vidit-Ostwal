  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested trying a feature branch by using a specific installation command. To revert back, a separate uninstallation and installation command should be executed. The feature reportedly enhances performance for certain models, specifically mentioning its effectiveness with qwen3:30b, while indicating it may not function correctly with gpt-oss:20b. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal has requested logs for further assessment and inquired about the possibility of exceeding the context limit. This information is crucial for understanding the feature's impact and usability.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to create a task with the context parameter set to None, despite the expectation that it should configure without any issues. The issue has been observed on macOS Sonoma, using Python version 3.11, with the latest versions of crewAI and crewAI Tools within a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and possible solutions have been provided in relation to this problem. Screenshots and relevant code snippets have also been included for clarity. There is no additional context to consider.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is a scenario missing in the task copying methods concerning the context attribute set as NOT_SPECIFIED. In this case, the copied version of the task should be made None. Additionally, the comment provides details about the operating system (Ubuntu 20.04), Python version (3.11), and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools, but no specific steps to reproduce the issue or evidence are provided. A possible solution is referenced in a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it's important to maintain clarity and conciseness in documentation for better comprehension. He emphasized the significance of clear communication in code comments and documentation, which ultimately enhances collaboration among developers.
