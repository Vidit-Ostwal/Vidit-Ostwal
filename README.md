  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a few changes to the implementation. Firstly, when memory is set to True, all memory types should be initialized, achieved by removing the check on `memory_config` for user_memory. Secondly, the UserMemory class should accept `memory_config` as a parameter, similar to short-term memory, to allow setting user_memory independently*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the usage of `memory_config` by adding a warning or validation layer to prevent misleading configurations. They propose ensuring mutual exclusivity, where the presence of the `user_memory` key prevents the use of other keys like `provider`. They also point out a missing test case for scenarios involving*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case to address issue #2260. The suggestion involves using a specific class and method to validate the fix. Additionally, the test case includes checks to ensure that certain methods return the expected values after the fix is applied. The proposed test aims to verify*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested improvements to the user memory configuration within the Crew class. The previous logic required checking for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` in `memory_config`. The updated logic simplifies this by primarily verifying if `memory_config` is provided. Instead of raising a TypeError, the revised implementation defaults to initializing `self._user_memory` from*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are used within a crew via the `crewai run` command. This process creates a virtual environment that mistakenly considers `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed universally, irrespective of whether*
