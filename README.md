  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests aligning feature developments with the maintainers' vision to avoid unnecessary work. They have encountered latency issues due to multiple API hits and believe that latency-solving bug fixes or feature requests will eventually arise. They emphasize that it is up to the maintainers to decide the appropriate approach, whether*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that only one or two agents can work simultaneously. While the current system is working, it's not production-ready and scaling more than 10 agents could cause latency issues. They believe this feature is crucial for making Crew AI more production-ready. @Vidit-Ostwal has offered to contribute to a*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that providing code examples would be beneficial. They recommend creating an output class for Task 1 with a "detail" field. The output from Task 1 can then be used as input for Task 2. However, in Task 2, the description lacks a definition for the "detail" parameter,*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON formatting to the output_log_file for improved parsability and analysis, partially addressing issue #1970. They are willing to contribute a pull request.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the purpose of `use_vision set = True` is not well understood. They have observed that setting this parameter to `True` saves a .gif but otherwise does not seem to impact the output of the agent. They are unsure if this parameter triggers multimodal processing of images*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. When initializing the crew, one can set output_log_file to True or provide a filename and enable save_as_json. The generated JSON file will include an array of JSON events, making it convenient for parsing and further analysis.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the parse_run_traces function to include the last four letters of the run_id of the trace. This change ensures a unique key for every call. The modification enhances the accuracy and uniqueness of the trace identification process, making it more reliable for tracking and analyzing specific traces.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the validate_samples functionality to pinpoint the problematic indexed sample. This enhancement provides more precise information when encountering validation issues, aiding in the identification and resolution of the underlying cause.*
