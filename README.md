  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested addressing the issue through prompt engineering. The proposed solution involves instructing the agent to specifically utilize an input format such as `search_query` when employing the tool. This approach aims to guide the agent in properly utilizing the tool by explicitly defining the expected input structure. By focusing*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the method of obtaining user input, questioning whether 'human_input' is being utilized. The response clarifies that 'human_input' is not the approach. Instead, the system uses a custom tool where questions are sent via websocket and the system then waits for the user to reply. This implies*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the reported issue might be resolved in the latest version. They investigated the matter by creating a new project using the command `crewai create crew Project-name`. Their examination revealed that all Ruff checks were successfully passed during the project creation. This observation indicates a potential fix*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the use of `try-except` blocks within the `crew-ai` framework is the primary reason for the observed behavior. These blocks are implemented to facilitate multiple attempts to solve a problem by an agent. The framework utilizes this functionality to enhance the agent's problem-solving capabilities through iterative attempts,*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the addition of functionality to incorporate runtime data from Human through the command-line interface (CLI). This enhancement broadens the system's capabilities by providing a direct method for integrating data. Future development plans involve extending this functionality with websockets, which will facilitate real-time communication and data transfer. This*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260. The test aims to verify the proper functioning of a specific feature. The new test case ensures that the system behaves as expected under certain conditions, contributing to the overall robustness and reliability. This addition strengthens the test suite*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on streamlining the user memory configuration within the Crew class. The original logic checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. The revised approach simplifies this by primarily checking for `memory_config`. If a `UserMemory` instance is provided, it's directly used. Otherwise,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The virtual environment created in this scenario inappropriately considers `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. The suggested solution is to ensure that `crewai_tools` is consistently installed, irrespective*
