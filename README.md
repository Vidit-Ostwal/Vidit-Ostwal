  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that to use selective task execution, one should utilize Process.selective as stated in the provided information. However, there is an error involving the creation of a task selector. The comment indicates a specific error related to the task_selector parameter. Instead, it was proposed that simply setting the process to Process.hierarchical may suffice, eliminating the need for the complex task selector. This adjustment could resolve the issues currently being faced in the implementation.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there appears to be a bug in version 0.121.0 related to the new integration with the rich library. They recommend upgrading the version or attempting the inference using the .py files to address the issue. This suggestion aims to resolve any potential problems caused by the integration, ensuring smoother functionality and performance moving forward. The focus is on troubleshooting the current version and improving compatibility with the relevant library.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue can be resolved by utilizing the hierarchical process. It is important to check the process attribute, as modifying it to sequential will change the execution order, causing all agents to run sequentially instead. This sequential setting is the default value, ensuring that users are aware of how the execution method can significantly impact the workflow. Adjusting these parameters can lead to a more efficient solution tailored to specific needs.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/pull/29) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Added get_tokenizer_with_new_tokens_func (2025-06-02).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested implementing a dynamic function that directly takes configuration from a configuration file. This function would enhance the tokenizer by allowing it to add tokens based on the provided configuration. This approach is aimed at improving flexibility and efficiency in the tokenization process, ensuring that it can adapt to varying requirements specified in the configuration file. Such functionality will streamline the workflow and make it easier to manage tokens dynamically according to user-defined settings.*
