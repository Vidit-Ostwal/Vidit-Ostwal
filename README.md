  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an alternative approach for running CrewAI asynchronously with multiple inputs, based on their understanding of the code. They propose utilizing the `kickoff_for_each_async()` method, which CrewAI provides as a specific way to handle such scenarios. They believe this method could potentially resolve the issue at hand. To determine*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the problem arises from how CrewAI manages custom embeddings when an embedder is provided within the crew. CrewAI's internal handling of embeddings differs from the approach used with tools. Specifically, the RAG tool relies on Embedchain, which currently does not support custom models. This lack of*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue might stem from ChromaDB's dimension locking. When a collection is initially created, it accepts vectors of any dimensionality. However, after the first embeddings are added, the collection locks to that specific dimensionality. This requires consistent use of the same embedding function for all subsequent*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying whether resetting the memory addresses the current issue. The inquiry focuses on determining the appropriate course of action to resolve a problem. Vidit-Ostwal is considering two potential solutions: resetting the memory or deleting the data folder and restarting from scratch. The goal is to understand which*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2616) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Broken Test Case (2025-04-16).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested there's a broken test case related to Mem0 storage, specifically in the `test_mem0_storage.py` file. The test failure occurs during the setup of `test_mem0_storage_with_explict_config`.
