  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggested that it's pointless to develop features that don't align with the maintainers' vision. He is facing an issue with latency in the API when there are multiple hits and believes that this problem will need to be addressed by the maintainers eventually. The approach to solving it, whether*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that currently, only one or two agents can work simultaneously on a task. Processing subsequent production requests is not possible until the current task is complete. This limits scalability and could lead to latency issues when scaling to more than 10 agents. They believe this limitation is*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that you provide a code example to clarify the issue raised. To resolve the issue, a new output class called 'Task 1' can be created with a 'detail' field. The output from 'Task 1' can then be passed as input to 'Task 2'. The 'detail' parameter in*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using the Sequential method is vital when the output of one agent is the input for another. However, if no flow is present for the entire process, then `kickoff()` can be executed asynchronously. The [documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews#different-ways-to-kick-off-a-crew) provides further details on this topic.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a new feature to enhance the logging functionality. Currently, the output logs are saved in a .txt format, which lacks parsability. To improve this, they propose incorporating JSON format in the logging file. This enhancement would enable better analysis and partially address issue #1970. They express willingness*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the purpose of `use_vision set = True` in agent definition. They question whether it triggers multimodal processing of images by the LLM or if it still relies on element scraping for decision-making. Furthermore, they inquire if there's a metric to assess whether multimodal image processing is*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file when initializing the crew. This is achieved by setting output_log_file to True or providing a file name (e.g., "log.json") along with setting save_as_json to True. The generated .json file will contain an array of JSON events for easy*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the parse_run_traces function to include the last four characters of the run ID in the trace, resulting in a unique key for each call. This modification ensures that each call has a distinct identifier, potentially resolving issues related to non-unique keys.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the `validate_samples` functionality to not only flag invalid samples but also pinpoint the exact indexed sample responsible for the issue. This enhancement offers greater clarity and eliminates the need to manually inspect each sample to identify the problematic one.*
