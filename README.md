  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior observed in the code may be specific to the particular input tensors used. They have observed that in a different case with the same input tensors but a constant `y_pred`, the result was as expected (`nan` was in the output). They believe that*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history` initializes parameters before crew kickoff and attempts to find a non-existent `detail` parameter. To resolve this, they recommend updating the description of `task 2` to specify the necessary output from `task 1` without explicitly setting parameters. Instead of specifying parameters in `task 2`, use phrases like*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the traces functionality to follow the format `{prompt_number} : {trace}`.

New traces should appear as:
`{'prompt_1': {'name': 'claim_decomposition_prompt', 'input': ClaimDecompositionInput(response='Eifel tower is in Paris'), 'output': ClaimDecompositionOutput(claims=['Eiffel tower is in Paris.'])}, ...}`*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the proposed solution makes sense from a user's perspective, as it simplifies the understanding of the flow. From an implementation standpoint, they believe it should be relatively straightforward. They have requested input from @jjmachan and indicated that they will incorporate the modification into the PR if*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests setting `output_log_file = True` when defining the crew to determine if the mail sending task is executing twice or if another agent is being called. They have also created a PR (#1985) to enhance log readability by saving them in JSON format. They offer to help integrate these*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal recognizes the importance of aligning contributions with maintainer vision. He is experiencing an issue with API latency that partially aligns with the proposed solution. He anticipates the need for a latency-solving solution in the future and suggests that maintainers consider implementing Kafka or a similar solution to address this*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format to the output_log_file as the current .txt format is not parsable. This JSON format will enable further analysis and partially address issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request for this change.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested guidelines for using the `use_vision` parameter. When set to `True` in agent definition, it saves a `.gif`. However, the key difference in output is unclear, as it still relies on scraping elements and making decisions. Additionally, the commentator asks about a cost metric to determine if multimodal*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file when initializing the Crew object. By setting the output_log_file parameter to True or specifying a file name and setting the save_as_json parameter to True, users can enable this feature. The resulting JSON file will contain an array of*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the parse_run_traces function to include the last four letters of the run_id of the trace. This change ensures that every call has a unique key, which is necessary to uniquely identify each call. The implementation details of the function are not included in the suggestion, as*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested altering the validate_samples functionality to include information on the specific indexed sample responsible for any encountered issues. By doing so, users can pinpoint the problematic sample and address it accordingly.*
