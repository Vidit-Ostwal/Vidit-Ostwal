  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has inquired about the correctness of the proposed solution. They tagged @jjmachan and @dosu, seeking their feedback and validation on the proposed solution. However, the specific details and context of the solution are not mentioned in the comment.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/torchmetrics/issues/2920#issuecomment-2629456251) in [Lightning-AI/torchmetrics] on 2025-02-02.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior observed in the code is likely unique to the specific input tensor being used. After analyzing the code, they noticed that a particular condition is being triggered, leading to a warning about potential instability due to low variance of certain inputs. Despite experimenting*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the code by removing the parameter from the task description and adding a general statement indicating that it should take the output from the previous task. This will resolve the error caused by the missing `detail` parameter and make the code more versatile.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880#issuecomment-2629385607) in [explodinggradients/ragas] on 2025-02-02.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the traces functionality to include `{prompt_number} : {trace}` formatting. This will make new traces appear in the following format: `{'prompt_1': {...}, 'prompt_2': {...}, 'prompt_3': {...}, 'prompt_4': {...}}` Each prompt's trace will contain information about the prompt name, input, and output. This change will provide a more*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the proposed solution aligns with the user perspective, making it easier to understand the flow. From an implementation standpoint, the change is expected to be straightforward. To proceed, @Vidit-Ostwal is seeking alignment from @jjmachan and will update the pull request if approved.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests implementing JSON format for the output log file to enable better parsing and analysis. This feature partially addresses issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal expresses willingness to contribute a pull request for this enhancement.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested discussing the purpose of `use_vision set = True` in agent definition. Specifically, they ask if the screenshot is processed solely by the multimodal LLM or if element scraping and decision-making methods are still used. Additionally, they inquire about cost metrics to determine if multimodal image processing is*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests adding support to save logs as a JSON file. This provides an easy way to parse and work with the logs. To utilize this feature, set output_log_file to True or provide a file name and set save_as_json to True when initializing the crew. The generated JSON file will*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested altering the parse_run_traces function. The change involves incorporating the last four characters of the run_id of the trace, creating a distinct key for each call. This modification ensures that each call has a unique identifier, potentially enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the tracing process.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the validate_samples functionality to provide specific information about the indexed sample that is causing an issue during validation. This enhancement will help users identify and address the problem more efficiently.*
