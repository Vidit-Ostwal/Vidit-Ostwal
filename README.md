  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that additional code needs to be added to the mem0_storage component. This update will be implemented after the completion and merging of the current pull request. The focus is on ensuring that the necessary changes are made in a sequential manner, prioritizing the existing changes before introducing new code. This approach aims to maintain code integrity and stability during the development process.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the reason messages are sent in the assistant role is due to changes in the framework. Specifically, the current implementation of the `save` method only sends and stores the Agent's replies. This behavior might have changed from V1 to V2, impacting how messages are exchanged. While some setups involve developers manually adding user messages, the transition to V2 has altered the search functionality, moving away from simple string queries to more complex filtering features. This change has implications for interaction retrieval by user ID.*

- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3217#issuecomment-3117611164) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-07-25.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a plan that includes fixing the issue with adding memories when the agent_id is provided, ensuring it is not dropped. Additionally, it is recommended to refactor the class and remove the user_id support until version 0.156.0, which is set for a deadline of August 4, 2025. This plan aims to streamline functionality and prepare for the eventual removal of the UserMemory class, ensuring alignment with developmental timelines and project goals.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3220) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Memory Save / Search Issue (2025-07-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested discussing the Mem0 Save and Search issue, highlighting that user-memory will be replaced by external memory soon. The current state involves using `assistant` for all messages while dropping the `agent_id` in search requests, causing complications when both `user_id` and `agent_id` are present. Proposed solutions include retaining `agent_id`, dropping `user_id` until a specified deadline, and altering how messages are sent to improve search accuracy by using an OR block instead of an AND block. This adjustment aims to enhance functionality moving forward.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/issues/3215) in [mem0ai/mem0]: Memory not saving with `infer=False` (2025-07-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while utilizing Mem0 for a project with CrewAI, there is an issue where memory is not being saved when `infer` is set to false. The user is only sending the assistant message and is questioning if they are making a mistake in this approach. However, they have noted that setting `infer` to true functions correctly without any issues. This discrepancy raises concerns about the expected behavior of the memory-saving feature in this configuration.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3225) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Dropping User Memory (2025-07-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested refactoring the class and eliminating support for user_id until version 0.156.0, or by the specified deadline of August 4, 2025. This modification is necessary to ensure the removal of the UserMemory class in line with the project's timeline. The suggestion emphasizes the importance of timely code updates to maintain compliance with future requirements, highlighting a proactive approach to software development and management.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3216) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the default value in Mem0 config (2025-07-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the `infer=False` setting is not functioning as intended, as the default value appears to be incorrectly set to `True`. This indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed within the system. The comment implies that further attention is required to resolve this matter effectively, possibly necessitating collaboration with the relevant team to correct the behavior of the `infer` parameter.*
