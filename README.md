  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the specific line, when combined with the previously mentioned code line, may result in the duplication of tool_result. This indicates a potential issue in the code logic that could cause the same output to be generated more than once, leading to inefficiencies or errors in the application's functionality. It is essential to review this aspect carefully to prevent unintended consequences in the code execution.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is an issue related to an if condition that requires modification. A proposed quick fix involves changing the condition from simply checking knowledge to a more comprehensive check that involves both knowledge and crew knowledge. This adjustment aims to enhance the functionality by ensuring that the condition adequately reflects the necessary checks. Implementing this change could potentially resolve the identified issue.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there appears to be a potential bug in the knowledge management system, specifically regarding the addition of source knowledge for Agents. They noted that when only defining knowledge at the Crew level, Agents do not gain access, which may not align with expectations. They clarify that Crew knowledge functions as general knowledge, accessible regardless of the specific Agent, while Agent knowledge is distinct and specific. A key guideline is to place knowledge intended for all Agents at the Crew level, and specific knowledge relevant to only one Agent at the Agent level.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested utilizing a specific model for implementing a large language model. They emphasize setting the temperature parameter to manage the randomness of outputs, with a recommended value of 0.7 for better results. Additionally, highlighting the importance of providing an API key for authentication when accessing the model is crucial. This approach aims to optimize performance while ensuring a secure connection to the model‚Äôs capabilities during implementation, making it a practical guideline for developers working with large language models.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2810) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added idea of initialising directly the knowledge instead of knowledge_sources (2025-05-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an improvement to the initialization process by proposing the direct initialization of knowledge rather than using a separate knowledge source. This suggestion is inspired by previous discussions, specifically referencing the context of issue number 2755. The aim is to streamline the initialization method, potentially leading to more efficient functionality in the project. This approach may help simplify the codebase and improve overall performance by eliminating the need for an additional source.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2765) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fix agent kn reset WPI (2025-05-06).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the recent commit introduces a feature to reset agent-specific knowledge through the command line interface (CLI). It includes the addition of a new command, `crewai reset-memories --akn`, which allows users to manage agent knowledge more effectively. Additionally, a new method named `_reset_agent_knowledge` has been implemented in the crew.py file to support this functionality. This update addresses issue number 2762, enhancing the overall interaction with the agents in the system.*
