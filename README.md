  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a feature to save logs as JSON files. This feature can be enabled by setting output_log_file to True or providing a file name and setting save_as_json to True. The generated JSON file contains an array of JSON events, simplifying parsing and analysis.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the parse_run_traces function to include the last four letters of the trace's run_id. This change generates a unique key for each call.
