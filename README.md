- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested investigating the purpose of the `use_vision` flag in agent definition. The purpose of the flag and its impact on agent behavior are unclear. Specifically, it is not clear whether the flag triggers multimodal processing of images, causing the agent to interpret images using the multimodal LLM, or*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a new feature to save logs as a JSON file. Users can now set output_log_file to True or provide a file name, and set save_as_json to True. This will create a JSON file containing an array of JSON events, making it easier to parse and work with.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the parse_run_traces function to include the last 4 letters of the run_id of the trace. This change results in a unique key for every call.
