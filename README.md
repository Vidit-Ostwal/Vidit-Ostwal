  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool. Each tool should be capable of initiating a crew managed by a parent crew. This hierarchical structure of crews and parent agents within tools allows for more efficient crew management and tool functionality. The parent crew can provide oversight and coordination,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the usage of `human_input`. It is called after the task is performed to assess the response's quality. Adding context during agent input is discouraged. Instead, all necessary input should be provided during `crew.kickoff()`.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that the `manager_note` feature may not be suitable for the manager LLM as it is internally just an agent. Instead, they propose allowing users to request the LLM to generate descriptions, goals, and context for the manager agent. This would leverage the LLM's ability to access and utilize*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2111) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] LiteLLM call fails, when `human_input` set to True (2025-02-12).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a possible solution to an issue where a crew with `human_input` set to True fails for any user input. The issue arises because the lite llm used in the crew is not given the user role in the messages. To resolve this, they recommend adding feedback in*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/8467) in [BerriAI/litellm]: [Bug]: Support to Google AI Studio (2025-02-11).

- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues/5432) in [langfuse/langfuse]: bug: Running Langfuse Locally Dcoker (2025-02-08).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the langfuse setup via Docker Compose fails because port 9000, used by both ClickHouse and MinIO, is occupied by another process. They believe that changing this port may not resolve the issue as it may be used internally elsewhere. The comment includes an error message indicating*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the code examples in the documentation for the "Concepts: Memory" section should use "model_name" as the input parameter for the embedder instead of "model". This inconsistency is present in the examples for Azure OpenAI Embeddings, Google AI Embeddings, Vertex AI Embeddings, and Cohere Embeddings.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format as an option for the output_log_file. Currently, the output_log_file is in .txt format, which is not easily parsable. JSON would provide a more useful format for analysis. This suggestion partially addresses issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request to implement this*
