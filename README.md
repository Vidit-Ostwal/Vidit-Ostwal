  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that tasks are designed to avoid direct knowledge source integration. Instead, knowledge definition should occur either at the crew level or at the individual agent level. This approach maintains a clear separation of concerns. By assigning knowledge sources to the crew or agents, task definitions remain focused*
