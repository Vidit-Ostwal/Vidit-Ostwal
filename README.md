  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested saving a unique file in the project and emphasized the importance of including the relevant embedder. The comment highlights that knowledge sources are chunked and retrieved, and points out that the default usage involves OpenAI models which require an OpenAI key. However, since a different model is being utilized, it is necessary to either provide the OpenAI key or set up the appropriate embedder function to ensure proper functionality within the project.*
