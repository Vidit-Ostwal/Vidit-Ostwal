  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when initializing the `MDXSearchTool`, it's crucial to pass a `config` parameter. This configuration should be a dictionary that specifies the settings for both the Language Model (LLM) and the embedder. The LLM configuration should include details like the provider (e.g., Ollama, Google, OpenAI) and model name*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested initializing each language model (LLM), but proposes initializing only one and assigning the same LLM to the others as a working alternative. In response to a query regarding the choice of OpenAI as the default LLM, Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that OpenAI's API gained prominence due to its*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that users can define their own Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrate them into the crew by utilizing the 'llm' parameter. This allows for customization and flexibility in selecting the specific model that best suits the task requirements. Furthermore, a code snippet demonstrates how to instantiate an*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the problem might be related to prompt engineering and proposes providing the language model with more information about the tool. To address this, they suggest replacing a specific function in the `base_tool.py` file with a revised version that offers enhanced details regarding the tool's functionality. The*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. An attempt was made to replicate the behavior using Gemini, but the issue was not observed in that environment. Therefore, understanding which LLM is in use is crucial for further investigation and potential resolution of the problem.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method for viewing the prompt sent to the language model (LLM) within the crewAI framework, noting that using verbose mode does not provide sufficient information. They identified the absence of a mechanism to directly inspect the final prompt before it's passed to the LLM. To address*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifications to address issue #2448, focusing on streamlining user memory configuration. The original code checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it's sufficient to verify the existence of `memory_config` with "mem0" as the provider. The new implementation simplifies the logic, initializing `self._user_memory`*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew with the `crewai run` command. The process of creating a virtual environment leads to `crewai_tools` being considered an optional dependency.
