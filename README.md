  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested providing a code example to clarify the issue. They propose creating an output class for Task 1 with a "detail" field. This output would serve as input for subsequent tasks. The raised issue stems from the presence of a "detail" parameter in 'task2' without a prior definition.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a feature to add JSON format support to the output_log_file. Currently, the log file is in .txt format, which is not easily parsable for further analysis. By adding JSON support, the log file will become more useful and will partially address issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the purpose of `use_vision=True` when defining an agent is unclear. They inquire whether screenshots are processed differently using multimodal LLM, or if they still rely on element scraping. They note that the only observed difference is the saving of a `.gif` file. Additionally, they seek a*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the `parse_run_traces` function to incorporate the last four characters of the `run_id` for each trace. By doing so, a unique key is generated for every function call, ensuring distinctiveness. This change addresses the issue of duplicate keys and enhances the accuracy of the function.*
