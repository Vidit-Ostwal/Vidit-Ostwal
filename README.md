  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that developing features that do not align with the maintainers' vision is futile. Currently, they are experiencing latency issues with multiple API hits, a problem that might require a solution like Kafka in the future. Although the proposed solution partially addresses their issue, they acknowledge that the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested enhancements to the system to improve production readiness and scalability. Currently, only one or two agents can work simultaneously, and processing additional requests from production is blocked until current tasks are completed. Scaling beyond 10 agents is challenging due to potential latency issues. To address these limitations,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it would be useful if you could provide your code. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal has recommended creating an output class for Task 1 with a field called "detail" and using the output of one task as the input for another task. This functionality is essential for communication between*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that Sequential is crucial when the output of one agent is the input for another. However, if there is no flow for the entire process, kickoff() can be run asynchronously. The documentation provided in the comment provides additional information on the different ways to kick off a crew.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON format option to the output_log_file for better parsability. This will also partially address issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to submit a pull request for this feature.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the purpose of `use_vision set = True` in defining an agent is unclear. They question if the screenshot is processed by the multimodal LLM or through traditional scraping and element analysis. Despite using `use_vision = True`, the output remains unchanged, with only a `.gif` being saved.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support for saving logs as a JSON file when initializing a crew. By setting `output_log_file` to `True` or a file name and `save_as_json` to `True`, the generated JSON file will include an array of JSON events, simplifying parsing and working with logs.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a modification to the `parse_run_traces` function. They have included the last four characters of the `run_id` in the function, making the key unique for each function call.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the validate_samples functionality to notify which indexed sample is responsible for any arising issues. This enhancement provides a more detailed and specific error message, enabling developers to swiftly identify and address the problematic sample within the dataset. By highlighting the exact sample causing errors, this improvement*
