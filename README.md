  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when initializing the `MDXSearchTool`, a `config` parameter needs to be passed. This configuration should be a dictionary containing settings for both the language model (`llm`) and the embedding model (`embedder`). The language model configuration includes the provider (e.g., "ollama") and specific model settings like the model*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that users can define their own Language Model and integrate it into the crew using the 'llm' parameter. This approach allows for customization and flexibility in selecting the desired LLM for specific tasks. The provided code snippet demonstrates how to define an LLM, specifying parameters such as*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue might stem from prompt engineering. To address this, they propose enhancing the information provided to the language model about the tool. A potential solution involves modifying a specific function related to generating descriptions. The suggested modification aims to provide more context on the functionality*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific language model being utilized, referencing a previous comment. They indicated having tested a similar scenario using Gemini, where the observed issue was not apparent. This suggests a potential difference in behavior or outcome depending on the language model in use. The intention is*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a way to view the prompt sent to the language model (LLM). They noted that using verbose mode doesn't provide sufficient information to see the final prompt. To address this, Vidit-Ostwal implemented a solution by adding a print statement. This print statement specifically targets the list of*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the prompt sets up an AI assistant designed to find information about people. The system message defines the AI's role as a "People Information Specialist" with the goal of analyzing questions, using tools to search for individuals, and providing concise findings. The AI is restricted to*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, detailing key logic changes related to user memory configuration within the Crew class. The prior code checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` in `memory_config`. The proposed logic simplifies this by verifying `memory_config`'s presence. It initializes `self._user_memory` with a `UserMemory` instance if provided*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are used within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. This process creates a virtual environment that treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is installed irrespective of whether any*
