  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that directly initializing a `UserMemory()` object is not feasible due to the way `self.memory_config` is initialized. This variable gets set to `crew.memory_config`, which would be `None` in the current scenario. Vidit-Ostwal highlights specific lines of code to further elaborate on this initialization behavior. He seeks guidance on*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on simplifying the user memory configuration within the Crew class. The original logic involved multiple checks for `memory_config` and `user_memory`, which was deemed inefficient. Instead, the revised approach streamlines the configuration process by directly initializing `self._user_memory` with a `UserMemory` instance. Now,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361 related to using tools within a crew with the `crewai run` CLI command. The issue arises because running a crew creates a virtual environment that considers `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. This means the tools are not always installed. Vidit-Ostwal proposes that*
