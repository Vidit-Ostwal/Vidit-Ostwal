  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. In their experience, an attempt to reproduce the described issue using Gemini did not reveal any problems. Therefore, to better understand the context and potentially identify the root cause of the reported behavior, @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method for viewing the prompt sent to the language model, noting that verbose mode doesn't provide sufficient information. They point out the lack of direct access to the 'final_prompt' used by the LLM. To address this, they implemented a solution by inserting a print statement within*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the prompt provided is designed for an AI assistant specializing in people information. The assistant's goal is to analyze user questions, utilizing tools to search for information about individuals. If the question pertains to a person, the assistant should search for and summarize relevant details. It*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential vulnerability in the code's robustness. Their concern revolves around the system's susceptibility to failure if the Language Model (LLM) introduces variations in its output format. Specifically, they highlighted that if the LLM were to generate a different nested dictionary structure with altered keys, the current*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a recent pull request removes existing validation by allowing a dictionary-like structure. While this addresses a specific issue, Vidit-Ostwal believes there are superior solutions. As the number of tools increases, the language model (LLM) should ideally learn and understand the necessary parameters in advance, optimizing the*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a consistent output format, like JSON or Pydantic, should be achievable when passing data between tasks. This improvement could ideally be incorporated into the templates defined in the `tasks.yaml` file. Vidit-Ostwal believes the current implementation adds all relevant information to the LLM's working memory, potentially eliminating*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested offering assistance in reproducing the code. They propose that if the code is shared, they can attempt to replicate it. This offer suggests a willingness to investigate or debug the code by independently creating a similar environment or scenario. Vidit-Ostwal is aiming to understand the original issue*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential solution involving prompt engineering to address the current challenge. The suggested approach involves instructing the agent to specifically include an input such as 'search_query' when utilizing the tool. This targeted prompting may guide the agent's behavior and lead to the desired outcome. The focus is*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying how user input is being obtained, questioning whether 'human_input' is in use. They noted the original poster clarified they are not using 'human_input.' Instead, questions are sent via WebSocket, and the system waits for the user's reply, indicating this is part of a custom tool. This*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the method used to obtain user input. The comment questions whether the user is employing a specific function or approach, such as 'human_input', to receive information from the user. The suggestion aims to understand the input mechanism better to provide relevant assistance or guidance. By identifying*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an enhancement involving the addition of runtime data from Human through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhancement aims to provide a more dynamic and interactive experience by incorporating real-time information directly accessible through the CLI. Furthermore, there are plans to broaden this functionality by implementing WebSocket*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case for issue #2260. This test case aims to verify that the `--ignore-whitespace-differences` flag effectively ignores whitespace variations during comparisons. The intention is to ensure that the `flake8-diff` tool functions correctly when encountering different types of whitespace. By introducing this test case, the tool's*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix related to user memory configuration. The current implementation checks for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, suggesting a more efficient approach of verifying only the presence of `memory_config` with "mem0" as the provider. When `user_memory` is a valid `UserMemory` instance, the initialization should remain unchanged.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. This process establishes a virtual environment that mistakenly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed universally, irrespective of whether any tools are*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
