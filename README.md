  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior observed in the code may be specific to the input tensor used. By analyzing the code, @Vidit-Ostwal identified a condition where the variance of the input tensors (var_x and var_y) is less than a certain threshold, which triggers a warning about potential instability*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal believes the error results from the function `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` attempting to use the `detail` parameter before it has been initialized. They suggest modifying `task 2` to use the output from `task 1` without specifying parameters. Instead, they suggest, if necessary, using a more general description like "take the `detail` parameter*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has updated the traces functionality to include the format `{prompt_number} : {trace}`. The new traces show the prompt name, input, and output for various prompt types, such as `claim_decomposition_prompt` and `n_l_i_statement_prompt`.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests considering the user perspective and making the flow easier to understand. They believe implementing this change should be relatively straightforward and seeks input from @jjmachan on whether they agree with this solution. If approved, @Vidit-Ostwal plans to update the PR accordingly.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a feature update to enhance the output_log_file format. Currently, the file is in the .txt format, which limits its utility for further analysis. The suggestion is to include a JSON format option in the logging file to provide more structured and parsable data. This enhancement would also*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the use of `use_vision=True` in agent definition. They question whether the screenshot is processed by the multimodal LLM or if it still relies on scraping elements for decision-making. They observe that using `use_vision=True` only saves a .gif with no apparent difference in output. They request a*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support for saving logs as a JSON file to the Crew initialization process. By setting output_log_file to True or a file name and save_as_json to True, users can generate a JSON file containing an array of JSON events. This simplifies parsing and working with the logs.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the `parse_run_traces` function to include the last four letters of the `run_id` of the trace, with the goal of creating a unique key for every call. This modification ensures that each call has its own distinct identifier.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the `validate_samples` functionality to provide more detailed error messages. The updated functionality will now specify which indexed sample is causing the issue. This improvement will enhance the debugging process by pinpointing the exact source of the error and making it easier to identify and*
