  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that developing features that do not align with the maintainers' vision is futile. They have encountered latency issues with multiple API hits and believe that maintaining latency is a problem that will eventually need to be addressed. While the proposed solution partially solves their problem, they propose that*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that only one or two agents should work at a time, depending on whether they need each other. Additionally, until the ongoing task is completed, no other production requests can be processed. They believe this is a necessary feature to enhance Crew AI's production readiness. Scaling over*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that providing a code example would be beneficial. They recommend creating an output class for Task 1 with a `detail` field to facilitate communication between agents. The current issue arises due to an undefined `detail` parameter in the description of Task 2.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests considering the use case when summarizing the usage of Sequential and kickoff() functions. If the agents have a sequential workflow where the output of one agent is the input for the next, Sequential is essential. However, if there is no defined flow and agents can run independently, kickoff()*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format to the logging files to make them parsable and support further analysis. This would also partially resolve issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request to implement this feature.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested seeking clarification on the `use_vision` parameter when defining an agent. They question whether enabling this parameter triggers multimodal processing of images using the LLM or if the system still relies on scraping elements for decision-making. They have noticed that the only apparent difference with `use_vision` enabled is*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. This can be enabled by setting the output_log_file parameter to True or a file name. Additionally, setting save_as_json to True will export logs as JSON events in the specified file. This JSON file can be easily parsed and*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the `parse_run_traces` function to incorporate the last four characters of the `run_id` of the trace. This modification ensures that each call has a unique key, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the function.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested enhancing the `validate_samples` functionality to identify and indicate the specific indexed sample that is triggering an issue. This improvement provides more detailed information and facilitates targeted troubleshooting, aiding in efficient issue resolution.*
