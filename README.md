  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potentially simpler approach to modifying the `search` functionality within `user_memory`. This involves altering the existing search function, using specified parameters, to ensure compatibility with the current CrewAI codebase. The aim is to integrate the changes seamlessly into the existing framework, streamlining the overall process. However, a*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that directly initializing a `UserMemory()` object is not possible due to how `self.memory_config` is initialized. The configuration gets initialized to `crew.memory_config`, which would be `None` in this specific scenario. This initialization issue arises because of the configuration's dependency on the `crew` context. The comment highlights specific lines*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested several changes to improve the `_fetch_user_context` functionality. The proposal includes an early return to optimize the process. To leverage user memory, a specific configuration dictionary with provider and config attributes is required, including a flag to enable its usage. This dictionary mandates the `user_id`, and optionally includes*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on streamlining user memory configuration. The current logic checks for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` which is inefficient. The suggestion simplifies the memory initialization process. Instead of raising a TypeError, the code now initializes `self._user_memory = Memory()` from mem0 by default. The*
