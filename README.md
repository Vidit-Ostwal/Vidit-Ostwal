  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that directly initializing a UserMemory object is not feasible because self.memory_config gets initialized to crew.memory_config, which would be None. This is a problem in the current implementation, and further investigation is required to determine the best course of action. Vidit-Ostwal mentions that the documentation has been updated*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested several changes to improve the code. Firstly, an early return will be implemented within the `_fetch_user_context` function. Secondly, users will need to set specific configurations to utilize `user_memory`, including defining the provider and configuring attributes such as `user_id`. The configurations also have optional attributes such as `org_id`,*
