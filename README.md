  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a need to modify the current implementation to address specific edge cases. Firstly, when `memory = True`, all memory types should be initialized by removing the check on `memory_config` for user memory. Secondly, the UserMemory class should accept `memory_config` as a parameter, similar to how short-term memory*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a warning or validation layer to prevent misleading usage of `memory_config`. Vidit-Ostwal questions whether the configuration should ensure mutual exclusivity, suggesting that if `user_memory` is present, other keys like `provider` should not be used. Vidit-Ostwal believes a test case is missing to cover scenarios where `user_memory`*
