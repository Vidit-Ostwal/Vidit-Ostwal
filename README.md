  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the reason for sending messages in the assistant role is worth considering. They have made a change in the save method but believe that sending both user and assistant messages would be beneficial. Currently, the framework only stores the agent's replies. They question whether this behavior has always been the case or if it changed with the transition from version 1 to version 2. They note that the search functionality has also evolved, moving from simple string queries to incorporating filter features.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3220) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Memory Save / Search Issue (2025-07-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested addressing the Mem0 Save and Search Issue with User-Memory being replaced by external memory in two weeks. Currently, messages sent to Mem0 are labeled as `assistant` messages, and the `agent_id` parameter has been removed during searches, causing complications. The proposed solutions include reintroducing the `agent_id`, refactoring to remove `user_id` until the specified deadline, sending a list of messages for Mem0 requests, and modifying the search filter logic to use an OR condition rather than AND for improved accuracy in searches.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3225) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Dropping User Memory (2025-07-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested refactoring the class and removing user_id support until the specified deadline of version 0.156.0 or August 4, 2025. This change aims to eliminate the UserMemory class, aligning the codebase with future updates and maintenance. The recommendation emphasizes the importance of adhering to the timeline for a smoother transition, ensuring that all necessary modifications are implemented before the cut-off date. This proactive approach will help maintain code quality and functionality in upcoming versions.*
