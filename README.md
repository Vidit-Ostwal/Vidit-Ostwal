  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested confirming whether the file path where the user's crew is running and the path in the terminal where they are executing the `crewai reset-memories -a` command are the same. This will help ensure that the command is targeting the correct crew.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool, alongside parent agents. The tool should be capable of initiating a crew, which would be managed by a parent crew. This would provide a hierarchical structure for managing crews and agents within the tool.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2095#issuecomment-2651664099) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-02-11.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that instead of using pre-computed settings or a generic manager, it would be more beneficial to have direct control over the settings. They believe this approach offers more flexibility and allows for better customization according to specific requirements.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2092#issuecomment-2651660502) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-02-11.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `human_input` is called after a task has been performed to ask for feedback on the generated response. They recommend providing all necessary input during the `crew.kickoff()` rather than adding it mid-execution.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2111) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] LiteLLM call fails, when `human_input` set to True (2025-02-12).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a solution to fix the issue where the crew fails for any user input when human_input is set to True. The problem arises because the lite llm is not assigned the user role in the messages. To resolve this, feedback should be added in the user role.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the sample code examples in the provided documentation links contain an error. The 'embedder' function takes the input of 'model' instead of 'model_name'. This issue needs to be fixed to align with the description provided in the documentation.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format support to the logging file to make it parsable for further analysis. This would also partially address issue #1970.
