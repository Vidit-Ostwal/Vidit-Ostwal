  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that, in the list of messages, the system prompt should be removed. The focus should be solely on retaining the user and assistant messages. This change aims to streamline the message list by eliminating unnecessary information, which would improve clarity and efficiency in the communication flow. Retaining only the relevant messages can enhance the overall user experience by providing a more direct and succinct overview of interactions.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exposing the exchanged messages by the Agent solely for External memory, allowing each storage implementation to choose which messages to include. Additionally, a modification to the Mem0 Storage is recommended. This change involves updating the save function's handling of messages, emphasizing the structure and context of the Assistant's dialogue and user interactions. The expectation is to deliver responses that are contextually appropriate, helpful, and engaging, with a focus on personalized user experience in future conversations.*
