  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a more straightforward approach by modifying the `search` functionality within `user_memory`. The aim is to ensure compatibility with the existing CrewAI codebase. This modification would involve adjusting the parameters of the `search` function to align with the codebase requirements. This suggestion focuses on streamlining the integration process.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there's an issue with the `search` functionality, which he didn't modify or test, and apologizes for the oversight. He highlights a `TypeError` stemming from an unexpected keyword argument 'metadata' in the `Memory.search()` function, referencing the Mem0 class's search signature. To align with Mem0's search, changes are*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that directly initializing a UserMemory object is not feasible due to the initialization of `self.memory_config` to `crew.memory_config`, which would be None. The comment highlights specific lines of code related to mem0_storage.py where the issue arises. Vidit-Ostwal seeks guidance on how to proceed with this problem and mentions*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested several changes to enhance the user context handling. Firstly, an early return will be implemented in `_fetch_user_context`. Secondly, to leverage `user_memory`, users must set a specific `memory_config` dictionary, ensuring key attributes like the provider and user ID are configured. Optional configurations like org ID, project ID, and*

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The process creates a virtual environment that incorrectly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal suggests that `crewai_tools` should be installed universally, irrespective*
