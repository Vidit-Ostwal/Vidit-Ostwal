  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the validation issue is similar to a previously encountered problem. The core issue might stem from how the tool description is generated, leading to incorrect usage, particularly with less sophisticated models. Currently, the tool arguments include descriptions, which may cause language models to generate nested dictionaries.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they tested the code with the gpt-3.5-turbo model and confirmed that it runs successfully without encountering any errors. They are seeking clarification regarding whether the successful execution is contingent upon a specific modification or if it functions correctly regardless of any changes made. The query implies*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested replacing the `_generate_description` function in the `base_tool.py` file with a modified version. This experiment aims to address a potential validation error. The function generates descriptions, determines the calling class, constructs an argument schema, and formulates usage instructions. It iterates through the arguments, defining example arguments based on*
