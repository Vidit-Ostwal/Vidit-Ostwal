  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that after downgrading to version 0.203.1, issues with calling being hallucinated ceased. A migration guide for version 1+ is sought, as the behavior differs significantly from previous versions. The experience with CrewAI has been educational but challenging, especially after upgrading to the 1.x version. It was emphasized that utilizing the latest version of CrewAI with the addition of specific settings might help, although the goal should be to rely on the native SDK rather than on previous dependencies.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/OpenEnv/pull/104#issuecomment-3475713573) in [meta-pytorch/OpenEnv] on 2025-11-01.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there are only two environments, `coding_env` and `git_env`, where smolagents are being installed. They request clarification on whether there are other environments requiring the removal of smolagents from the environment Docker file. This inquiry aims to ensure that all relevant environments are addressed in the proposed changes, improving the overall system configuration. The suggestion emphasizes the need for a comprehensive review of all environments to enhance functionality and compliance.*

## 🐛 Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to set a task with a context parameter set to None on macOS Sonoma using Python version 3.11 with the latest versions of crewAI and crewAI tools in a Conda virtual environment. The expected behavior is for the configuration to proceed without issues. Evidence and screenshots have been provided, as well as a possible solution indicated in another issue. Additional context was not provided in the comment.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when utilizing the aforementioned methods, there's an overlooked scenario during task copying where the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED. In this case, the current structure should result in the copied task being set to None. There are no specific steps to reproduce this issue, and no expected behaviors, screenshots, or additional context have been provided. The comment also notes the use of Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.11 with the latest versions of the crewAI and crewAI Tools.*
