  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that developing features misaligned with maintainers' visions is futile. He faces latency issues in the API with multiple hits and partially solves the problem with the proposed solution. He believes that maintainers will eventually address latency-solving bug or feature requests. The approach to solving the problem, whether through*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests addressing a performance bottleneck in Crew AI where only one or two agents can work simultaneously, preventing processing of additional requests. They propose using a message broker like Kafka to increase the number of concurrent agents and reduce latency issues. @Vidit-Ostwal expresses interest in contributing to a potential*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a "detail" field could be added to the output class for Task 1. This field could contain the output of Task 1, which would then be used as input for Task 2. This would address the issue in 'task2' where the "detail" parameter is not yet*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested considering the usage of the Crew. Sequential is essential when the output of one agent is used as input for another. In cases where there is no defined flow for the entire process, `kickoff()` can be run asynchronously. Refer to the provided [documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews#different-ways-to-kick-off-a-crew) for further details.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a feature to improve the output logging file currently in a .txt format. This proposed feature would enhance the log file by supporting the JSON format to make it more parsable and suitable for further analysis. The JSON format addition also partially addresses issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal expresses*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reviewing the impact of setting `use_vision` to `True` when defining an agent. They have noticed a difference in the storage format of the generated screenshot, but no discernible change in the output. Therefore, they inquire about metrics or indicators to confirm if multimodal image processing is actually*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file. By setting `output_log_file` to `True` or providing a file name (e.g., "log.json") and setting `save_as_json` to `True` when initializing the crew, logs can be saved in JSON format. This simplifies parsing and working with the logs.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a modification to the 'parse_run_traces' function in the code. The function now incorporates the last four characters of the 'run_id' of the trace, ensuring a unique key for each call. This enhancement eliminates potential issues arising from duplicate 'run_id' values.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifying the validate_samples functionality to identify and report the problematic indexed sample causing issues. This enhancement will help pinpoint and address the specific sample causing validation problems.*
