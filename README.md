  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that implementing a summarization feature could enhance the process. Specifically, it may be beneficial to summarize after reaching a certain threshold, such as 75% of the tokens, rather than waiting until 100% is achieved. This approach could provide timely insights and allow for a more efficient summarization process by addressing information in stages. He seeks feedback on this proposal to optimize the summarization mechanism further.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested using version 0.121.1 of a specific library while working in Jupyter Notebook. The code utilizes multiple agents including a planner, writer, and editor, each with distinct roles focused on creating a blog post about a given topic. The tasks involve prioritizing trends, drafting the content, and proofreading for style and grammar. It is advised to use .py files for inference to enhance the execution process within the environment. The detailed structure emphasizes collaboration to produce quality content effectively.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested appreciation for the Smolagent codebase, highlighting its value in learning about AI agents. The feature request addresses a problem where a knowledge bot, integrated with various tools, occasionally calls irrelevant API endpoints. While it can backtrack, the persistence of irrelevant messages in the context window leads to increased costs and degraded performance. To tackle this, an optimization feature allowing removal or compression of old messages is proposed, noting that current options do not support this, alongside considering alternative compression methods.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an issue arises where the last task sentence repeats multiple times, leading to a recursion error due to maximum recursion depth being exceeded. Additionally, there are SSL certificate verification issues when connecting to a telemetry service. To remedy this, it is recommended to upgrade the crewai version or consider using Python files for inference to avoid the recurring problem and ensure proper functioning without encountering SSL issues.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the method of handling tools in crewai involves adding them to the description instead of sending them directly to litellm. The tools are integrated into the description that is sent to litellm. He mentioned issues with the LLM generating descriptions as a key, which can be addressed through prompt engineering. Given the changes in how the tool function definitions appear, he proposed the option to eliminate the description or modify the argument presentation since the arguments are not sent in the manner shown.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/pull/29) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Added get_tokenizer_with_new_tokens_func (2025-06-02).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested implementing a dynamic function that can directly accept configuration from a file. This function is intended to enhance the tokenizer by adding tokens based on the provided configurations. This approach aims to streamline the process of managing token additions and improve the tokenizer's flexibility and adaptability to different needs. The use of a configuration file will allow for easier adjustments and customization without the necessity to alter the core code directly.*
