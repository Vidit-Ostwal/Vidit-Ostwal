  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool and adding parent agents. The tool should have the ability to initiate a crew, which would then be managed by a parent crew. This approach would allow for more flexibility and control in managing crews and tools.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggested clarifying the usage of `human_input`. The function is called after task execution to gather feedback on the generated response. Adding additional context during crew execution is not recommended. Instead, all necessary input should be provided during `crew.kickoff()`. This approach ensures a more streamlined and efficient workflow.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2095#issuecomment-2650913664) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-02-11.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that it's a good idea to provide context and information about the agents and tools that the manager LLM can utilize. However, they have raised a concern that internally, the manager LLM is essentially an agent itself, so adding a "manager_note" specifically for this agent may not*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue may stem from a security process running on port 9000. This process is preventing the desired application from starting on that port. Due to its nature, it cannot be terminated.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the user just tried again, providing logs for reference. The provided logs contain a mix of log entries from various microservices and databases, including Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, MinIO, and Langfuse components. These logs generally indicate that the services started successfully, but there were issues with applying*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the ports for Clickhouse and Minio in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration to resolve the issue being faced. Specifically, the Clickhouse external port is updated to 9009, and the Minio external port is updated to 9010. They believe that this change may address the problem, but further investigation*
