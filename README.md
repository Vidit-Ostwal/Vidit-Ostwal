  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring the possibility of passing knowledge at the agent level. This approach aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the system by ensuring that the agents can directly utilize shared information. By implementing this method, it may lead to improved collaboration and performance among the agents, ultimately benefiting the overall functioning of the project. The suggestion emphasizes the importance of knowledge transfer within the agent framework for better outcomes.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested uncertainty regarding model training duration. They noted that by mistakenly not passing the correct model variable, the fine-tuning process took around 11 hours for one epoch of the entire dataset. Despite configuring the model with Qlora afterward, the training time remained roughly the same. This outcome appeared counterintuitive to them, prompting a query about the consistency of training times under different model configurations.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they successfully fine-tuned the model using the QLORA model and an updated tokenizer. This achievement highlights progress in enhancing model performance and efficiency. The comment emphasizes the positive outcome of this endeavor, indicating a step forward in their project related to object detection. Further details or findings may be discussed, but the key takeaway is the successful implementation of the QLORA model in combination with the improved tokenizer for better results.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/19) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Add location tokens to tokenizer and train the embedding (2025-05-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that they are unsure about the main concept being discussed and are seeking clarification. They express that they are new to the topic and haven‚Äôt been able to understand what needs to be done. To assist, they request basic surface-level ideas that would help them gain a better understanding of the situation. They conclude the comment with a note of appreciation, indicating their willingness to learn more.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection/issues/15) in [ariG23498/gemma3-object-detection]: Error configuring (2025-05-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested addressing an error encountered while implementing a data loader. The user is attempting to integrate a `train_dataloader` and encountered a ValueError related to an invalid pattern. This issue arises during the dataset loading phase, specifically when the pattern includes '**' without being a complete path component. The user provided a function for fetching the dataset and constructing the data loader, which may require adjustments to resolve the issue effectively. Debugging this problem will help successfully implement the data loader within the existing file system.*
