  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that in the list of messages, it is important to remove the system prompt. The focus should remain solely on the user and assistant messages to streamline the message presentation. This change aims to enhance clarity and improve user experience by avoiding unnecessary information that may distract from the main interactions. Prioritizing user and assistant exchanges will create a cleaner and more efficient messaging format.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exposing entire exchanged messages from the Agent solely for External memory, allowing each storage implementation to select the relevant messages. Additionally, a modification to the Mem0 Storage is proposed. The change involves adjusting the saving method to ensure that messages adhere more closely to a defined structure, which emphasizes maintaining context and providing personalized interactions in responses. This adjustment aims to enhance the assistant's ability to deliver contextually appropriate, helpful, and friendly replies to user inquiries.*
