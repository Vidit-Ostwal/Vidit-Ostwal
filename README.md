  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific language model being utilized by the other user. They mention testing a similar scenario with Gemini and not encountering the reported problem. The suggestion stems from an attempt to understand the discrepancies in observed behavior across different language models. The aim is to*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method for viewing the final prompt sent to the language model. They observed that using verbose mode did not provide sufficient information to see the complete prompt. To address this, they directly modified the code to print the list of messages just before the call to*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the current implementation may be fragile. A primary concern is the potential for failure if the 'llm' system introduces a different nested dictionary structure with altered keys in the future. This change could render the current parsing logic ineffective. The suggestion implies a need for a*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a recent pull request by devin eliminates crewai's initial validation by permitting a dictionary-like structure. While this resolves the immediate issue, Vidit-Ostwal believes a more robust solution is needed for future tool integration. As the number of tools grows, the language model should intelligently determine necessary*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while the solution worked, there should be a mechanism to consistently pass output from one task as input to another, potentially using JSON or Pydantic models. Vidit-Ostwal proposes that this functionality should be incorporated into the templates within the `tasks.yaml` file. Vidit-Ostwal believes that since all*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448 by modifying the logic for user memory configuration. They identified inefficiencies in the original code, particularly in checking for both `memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. Vidit-Ostwal has proposed simplifying the configuration process, allowing users to configure user memory by directly providing a*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. This process creates a virtual environment that incorrectly treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is installed unconditionally, irrespective*
