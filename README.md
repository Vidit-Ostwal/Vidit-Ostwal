- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3786#issuecomment-3438698097) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-10-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a replica of a pull request has been created in the deprecated crewai-tools library. This indicates an effort to maintain or adapt features from the original pull request within a library that is no longer actively supported. The creation of such replicas often aims to ensure that functionality is preserved or available for future reference, despite the deprecation status of the library. This action reflects ongoing development interest in maintaining legacy code.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/485#issuecomment-3438661519) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools] on 2025-10-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the crewai tools should be added to the main repository since the current repository is deprecated. This indicates a need for integrating the necessary tools into an active environment to ensure continuity and functionality. Furthermore, acknowledgment was made regarding the deprecation, and there is an intention to create a new Pull Request to address this issue. The suggestion emphasizes the importance of keeping the tools accessible and updated within the main repository.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using system exit is not advisable as it hinders the integration of a larger system that may need to respond appropriately. Instead, implementing an exception would be more beneficial, allowing for alternative actions. Additionally, the suggestion includes setting the respect_context_window option to true, which would provide a functionality to summarize when the context window exceeds its limits, enhancing overall system functionality and responsiveness.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a custom listener class to handle specific events. This involves initializing the class and setting up methods to listen for LLM stream chunk events. The proposed implementation includes a dedicated function to process the incoming events and output their details. Overall, this addition aims to enhance the event handling capabilities within the application, ensuring that relevant event data is appropriately captured and processed for further actions or analysis. The focus is on improving functionality through effective event management.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to execute a task while using a None context parameter. The expected outcome is that the configuration should occur without any issues. The issue has been reproduced on macOS Sonoma, utilizing Python version 3.11, and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools within a Conda virtual environment. The comment includes screenshots and mentions a possible solution referencing an existing issue. No additional context has been provided regarding the problem.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when using the specified methods, there is a missing case for task copying. Specifically, if the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED, the structure should allow the copied task version to be set to None. There are no steps to reproduce, expected behavior, screenshots, or evidence provided. The user is operating on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.11 and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools within a virtual environment.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there are important considerations to keep in mind while implementing features. He emphasizes the need for clear documentation and consistent coding practices to ensure maintainability. Additionally, he highlights the significance of thorough testing to identify potential issues early in the development process. Finally, he encourages collaboration and open communication among team members to facilitate a smooth development workflow and improve overall productivity, which ultimately leads to a more successful project outcome.*
