  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method to view the prompt sent to the language model (LLM). Observing that the `verbose` setting doesn't provide sufficient information to see the final prompt. They addressed this limitation by printing the `messages` list immediately before the LLM call within the `crew_agent_executor.py` file. This modification allows*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential vulnerability regarding the robustness of the current approach when dealing with Language Model (LLM) responses. The central concern is the application's susceptibility to failure if the LLM were to alter the structure of the nested dictionary it provides, especially by introducing different keys. This highlights*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a recent pull request removes crucial validation within CrewAI by permitting a dictionary-like structure. While this resolves the immediate issue, Vidit-Ostwal believes a superior solution exists. As the number of tools expands, the language model (LLM) should autonomously discern the necessary parameters by learning about the*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested acknowledging the solution's effectiveness while questioning the need for a defined input/output structure between tasks. They propose that tasks should seamlessly exchange data, ideally in a standardized format like JSON or Pydantic, and be integrated into the `tasks.yaml` templates. Vidit-Ostwal believes data from one task can be*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260, focusing on verifying the expected behavior when the `include` list is empty. The addition aims to ensure that even when no specific items are included, the system gracefully handles the scenario. This contribution is intended to improve the robustness*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested improvements to the user memory configuration logic. The original code checked for both `memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. The updated logic simplifies this by primarily verifying the presence of `memory_config`. The revised code streamlines the process, by ensuring that if a `UserMemory` instance is provided, it's directly*
