  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the behavior observed is primarily due to the use of `try-except` blocks within the `crew-ai` framework. These blocks are employed because the framework has a built-in functionality that allows it to make multiple attempts to achieve a successful agent run. The utilization of `try-except` structures facilitates*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an enhancement focused on incorporating runtime data from Human through the command-line interface. This addition aims to streamline the process of integrating real-time information into the system. Future development plans involve expanding this functionality with the implementation of websockets. This extension is intended to facilitate more dynamic*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260, specifically targeting a scenario involving default value updates. The test aims to verify that when the default value of a field changes, the corresponding value in existing documents also gets updated accordingly. This ensures data consistency across the database.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to address issue #2448, focusing on streamlining user memory configuration within the Crew class. The original logic checked for both `memory_config` and `user_memory`, which Vidit-Ostwal proposes simplifying by directly verifying the presence of `memory_config`. The revised code initializes `self._user_memory` based on whether `user_memory_config` is a `UserMemory`*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. This process establishes a virtual environment, mistakenly treating `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal suggests ensuring that `crewai_tools` is consistently installed, irrespective of whether specific*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the work done in issue #2422. The primary focus of this contribution is to refine the existing codebase by eliminating an extraneous test case. This action aims to improve the overall efficiency and maintainability of the project. The removal of this test case helps to*
