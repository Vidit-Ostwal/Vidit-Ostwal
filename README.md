  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that when using a generator to yield a value in a flow, it should be iterated to obtain the actual value. The example code demonstrates this by utilizing the langchain_google_genai and crewai libraries to generate a random city and a fun fact about that city. The flow yields*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested expanding the `get_crew` functionality to work with their CLI commands.

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the issue may arise from the way `reset_memory_command` executed from the CLI initializes `short_term_memory` and `entity_memory`, differing from their initialization in `crew.py`. While `reset_memory_command` is suitable for `long_term_memory` and `knowledge_memory`, direct CLI commands may not work for custom memory initialization.*
