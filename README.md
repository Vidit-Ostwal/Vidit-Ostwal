  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool, along with parent agents. The tool should have the capability to kick off a crew, managed by a parent crew. This approach will facilitate hierarchical organization and task delegation within the tool.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `human_input` is used to assess the generated response after a task is performed. While incorporating additional context during agent input may not be optimal, providing all necessary input during `crew.kickoff()` could be a better approach. This ensures that the agent has the required context before task*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested including context about the agents or tools a manager LLM can use in the context hints section. However, they believe adding a `manager_note` specifically for one agent may not be optimal due to the LLM's internal structure, where it functions as an agent. Additionally, they suggest that*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the root of the problem lies in the inability to use port 9000. This is because a security process is running on that port and cannot be terminated. As a result, they are unable to proceed with their current course of action.*
