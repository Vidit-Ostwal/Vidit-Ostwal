## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the sample code examples in the CrewAI documentation for using embeddings incorrectly use the "model" parameter instead of the "model_name" parameter. This issue is present in the documentation for Azure OpenAI, Google AI, Vertex AI, and Cohere embeddings integrations.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format to the output_log_file to make it parsable and address issue #1970.

- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested looking into the utility of `use_vision set = True` when defining an agent. They inquire whether it triggers multimodal processing of images by the LLM or if it still relies on scraping elements and making decisions based on that. They noticed that the only observable difference with*
