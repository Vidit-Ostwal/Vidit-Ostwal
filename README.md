## üêõ Issues Raised

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the bug in setting up LangFuse via Docker Compose is due to port 9000, used by ClickHouse and Minio, being occupied by another process.

- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2030) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Documentation Error in memory docs (2025-02-04).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the CrewAI documentation for memory mentions the embedder taking the input of `model` instead of `model_name`, which is incorrect.
