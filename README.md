  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior observed is likely due to the specific input tensors used. They identified that the condition `(var_x < bound).any() or (var_y < bound).any()` is being hit, which triggers a warning about instability in calculations due to near-zero variance in the input data. They have*
