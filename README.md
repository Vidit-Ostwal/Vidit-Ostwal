  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an issue arose when using the `Crew(verbose=True)` method within a Jupyter Notebook. While testing a setup with three agents and sequential tasks, a crash occurred due to a `RecursionError`, stemming from conflicts between the `rich` logging system and Jupyter's rendering. To temporarily resolve this, a workaround was implemented by overriding `rich.Console` to prevent terminal rendering in Jupyter, allowing successful execution with detailed logging without encountering recursion errors.*
