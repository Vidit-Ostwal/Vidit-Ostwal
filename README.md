## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a JSON format option to the output_log_file. Currently, the file is in .txt format, which limits its parsability and analysis capabilities. The JSON format would address this issue and partially fulfill the request in issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal expresses willingness to contribute a pull request for this*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifications regarding the use of `use_vision` parameter when defining an agent. This parameter determines if the agent should use image recognition for decision-making. When set to `True`, the agent will use both image recognition and element scraping for decision-making. However, the difference between using `use_vision=True` and `use_vision=False`*
