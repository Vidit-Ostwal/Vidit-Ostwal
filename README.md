  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the library is not yet stable enough to function effectively. They attempted to work with several versions, including 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.4, 0.3.5, and 0.3.7, noting that version 0.3.6 is no longer available. However, none of these versions proved stable enough to proceed without encountering errors. Therefore, further stability improvements are needed before continuing with development or implementation.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested reviewing the provided documentation to understand CrewAI telemetry better. The key message is the option to disable telemetry, which can enhance privacy or reduce unwanted data transmission. There are two configurations to consider: disabling only CrewAI telemetry or disabling all OpenTelemetry, which includes CrewAI. This can be crucial for users who want to control their data usage and optimize their environment settings effectively.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to create a task with a context parameter set to None, contrary to expected behavior where the configuration should proceed without issues. This issue has been observed on macOS Sonoma using Python version 3.11, as well as with the latest versions of crewAI and its tools, and within a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and details have been provided, along with a reference to a potential solution. No additional context has been given.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when utilizing the specified methods, there's a missing case related to task copying. Specifically, when the context attribute is NOT_SPECIFIED, the current structure should result in the copied task version being set to None. There are no steps to reproduce or expected behaviors noted. The issue was encountered on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.11 and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools. No additional context or evidence is provided regarding this matter.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
