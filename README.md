  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that when initializing the `MDXSearchTool`, a `config` parameter should be passed. This configuration parameter is a dictionary containing settings for the language model and embedder. The language model configuration includes specifying the provider, such as "ollama", along with its specific model and optional parameters. Similarly, the embedder*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. They mentioned testing the scenario with Gemini and reported that the issue in question was not observed during their experimentation. Therefore, understanding which LLM is being used is crucial for further analysis and troubleshooting, as different models*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method for viewing the prompt sent to the language model (LLM) because utilizing verbose mode does not provide sufficient information. To achieve this, they added a print statement within the `crew_agent_executor.py` file. Specifically, the print statement captures and displays the list of messages that are about*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260. The test case aims to address a specific scenario involving the `validate` method. This addition is intended to improve the overall testing coverage and ensure the robustness of the `validate` function in handling various input conditions. The new test*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on improving user memory configuration within the Crew class. The original code was deemed inefficient due to redundant checks. The revised implementation streamlines the configuration process by primarily verifying the presence of `memory_config`. Instead of raising a TypeError, the updated logic*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. This process creates a virtual environment that incorrectly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is consistently installed, irrespective of whether*
