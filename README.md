  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that instead of fixing everything at once, which could result in numerous conflicts with existing pull requests, the approach should be to only apply linter checks to changed files. This strategy aims to minimize disruptive conflicts and streamline the review process, ensuring that updates can be integrated smoothly without overwhelming existing work. Adopting this method balances the need for code quality with practical project management.*
