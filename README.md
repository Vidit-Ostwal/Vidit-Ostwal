## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3696) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Task can't be configured when passing None as a context parameter via YAML (2025-10-11).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an error occurs when attempting to execute a task with a context parameter set to None. The expected behavior is for the task to configure without any issues. The issue is reproducible on macOS Sonoma using Python version 3.11 with the latest versions of crewAI and crewAI Tools in a Conda virtual environment. Evidence and potential solutions have been provided, indicating that this problem is documented and might be linked to a specific issue.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3691) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Kickoff_for_each and Kickoff_for_each_async doesn't copy task correctly. (2025-10-10).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that while using certain methods, a scenario is overlooked when a task is copied. Specifically, when the context attribute is set to NOT_SPECIFIED, the current structure should result in the copied task being assigned a value of None. There are no steps to reproduce the issue, nor are there any expected outcomes. The problem pertains to specific versions of software being used, notably Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.11, along with the latest versions of crewAI and its tools.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/issues/478) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Qdrant_Search_Tool Retireval doesn't work (2025-10-04).
