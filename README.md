  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the use of `try-except` blocks within the `crew-ai` framework is the primary reason for the observed behavior. These blocks are implemented to enable the framework to make multiple attempts at solving agent-related tasks. The functionality of `crew-ai` involves attempting solutions iteratively. This approach is intrinsic to*

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix that simplifies the user memory configuration. The prior code checked for both `memory_config` and `user_memory` which introduced inefficiency. The updated logic streamlines this by verifying only if `memory_config` exists. This change ensures that if a valid `UserMemory` instance is present, it's directly used, otherwise, it*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` command. This process creates a virtual environment that mistakenly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is installed irrespective of whether specific tools*
