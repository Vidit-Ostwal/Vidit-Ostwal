  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a specified limit. This approach is favored for its efficiency compared to trial division, particularly when dealing with larger ranges. The suggested implementation utilizes a boolean array to mark composite numbers, optimizing space and time*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested initializing all language models (LLMs) or initializing one and assigning it to others. He believes OpenAI's API became the default due to its early adoption and widespread use. Other companies, like DeepSeek, ensure their APIs are compatible with OpenAI's for easier integration. He compares this to a*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested defining a custom Language Model and incorporating it into a crew via the 'llm' parameter. This approach allows users to leverage specific models according to their needs. The suggestion involves configuring an LLM instance with parameters like the model name and temperature, enabling tailored agent behavior within*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested checking if a previously discussed solution was effective for the user. The suggestion indicates a follow-up on a prior interaction or proposed fix. The purpose is to confirm whether the user, addressed as "iam1492", experienced a positive outcome following the implementation of that specific solution. This ensures*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that an upgrade to the latest version may resolve the issue. Testing with the updated version is recommended to determine if it addresses the problem effectively. This approach aims to leverage the improvements and bug fixes incorporated in the newer version to potentially overcome the encountered challenges.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the problem might be related to prompt engineering, and providing the LLM with more information about the tool could potentially resolve it. They propose a specific solution involving replacing a particular function to enhance the information provided about the tool's operation. The suggested function focuses on*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. They mentioned testing the scenario with Gemini and did not encounter the reported issue. The comment aims to understand the environment where the problem arises by identifying the specific LLM in use. Understanding this context might help*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method to view the final prompt sent to the language model (LLM). Observing that the `verbose` setting does not provide sufficient information, they propose printing the prompt immediately before the LLM call to inspect the `final_prompt`. To achieve this, they added a print statement to the*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a system prompt for an AI assistant designed to be a People Information Specialist. The AI should analyze user questions, determine if they are about a person, and use available tools to search for information. The specified tool is "Search a JSON's content", which searches a JSON*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested there's a potential fragility in the current approach. The primary concern revolves around the structure of the `llm`'s output. Specifically, if `llm` were to return a differently structured nested dictionary with varying keys, the current implementation would likely fail. This highlights a dependency on a specific, unchanging*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding functionality to incorporate runtime data from Human through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhancement allows users to integrate real-time information from the Human system directly into the application by using CLI commands. The initial implementation focuses on CLI integration, with future plans to expand capabilities*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case for issue #2260. The suggestion aims to ensure comprehensive coverage and validation related to a specific problem. The inclusion of a test case improves the robustness and reliability of the solution by verifying its correctness. It also facilitates future maintenance and regression testing,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, focusing on simplifying the user memory configuration within the Crew class. The original implementation involved multiple checks for `memory_config` and `user_memory`, which Vidit-Ostwal aims to streamline. Vidit-Ostwal proposes modifying the logic to primarily check for the presence of `memory_config` with "mem0" as*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, addressing a problem encountered when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The core issue arises from the creation of a virtual environment that mistakenly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. This leads to complications in certain scenarios.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the work done in issue #2422. The comment indicates a continuation of efforts related to a previous issue. Vidit-Ostwal also states that they have removed an unneeded test case. This suggests a refinement of existing tests, possibly to streamline the testing process or improve test*
