  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested incorporating a crew within a tool and setting up parent agents. The crew inside the tool can be managed by a parent crew. This will allow the tool to kick off a crew based on the commands from the parent crew. By implementing this, we can achieve*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that pre-computed or generalized managers may be available, but it would be advantageous to maintain control over such aspects within the code. This would allow for greater customization and flexibility in managing the desired behavior and functionality.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggests that the `human_input` function should be called after the task has been performed and used to gather feedback on the quality of the generated response. Adding additional input context during the crew execution is discouraged. Instead, all necessary inputs should be provided during the `crew.kickoff()` method.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that including context about the agents or tools available to the manager LLM is a good idea. However, they raise the concern that adding a `manager_note` specifically for the manager LLM may not be the best approach since it is essentially just another agent internally. Instead, they*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/2111) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] LiteLLM call fails, when `human_input` set to True (2025-02-12).

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested addressing a port conflict issue during Langfuse setup using Docker Compose. Specifically, port 9000, used by both Clickhouse and Minio, is already occupied. Changing the port externally may not resolve the issue as it is likely used internally as well. The commenter seeks assistance in identifying all*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the CrewAI documentation for embeddings samples should use `model` as the parameter instead of `model_name` to match the actual usage. This is recommended for the CrewAI documentation pages covering Azure OpenAI, Google AI, Vertex AI, and Cohere embeddings. The reason for this change is to align*

This generates a .json file containing an array of JSON events, making it easier to parse and*
