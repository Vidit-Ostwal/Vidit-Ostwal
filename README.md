- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216682728) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that there is no scenario where CrewOutput is created without task_outputs based on an analysis of the code. They emphasized the importance of confirming this observation with a maintainer to ensure accuracy and gather a second opinion. This recommendation aims to enhance understanding of the code's functionality and prevent potential misunderstandings regarding CrewOutput's instantiation.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3185#issuecomment-3216270555) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-23.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that skipping a specific test case related to CrewOutput instances might be a good idea, as direct instantiation without task_outputs should not lead to issues in typical scenarios. Furthermore, there seems to be confusion regarding the requirements for creating CrewOutput objects directly compared to the crew.kickoff() method. To improve this situation, @Vidit-Ostwal believes it's best to handle errors related to missing TaskOutput within the CrewOutput class itself, proposing the addition of a check to better manage this scenario.*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested debugging the issue and requested the project file along with the implementation details of the tools being used. This will aid in understanding the current setup and identifying potential problems more effectively. Sharing these resources is essential for collaborative troubleshooting, as it allows for a thorough analysis of the situation and contributes to finding solutions promptly. By having access to this information, a clearer approach towards resolving the issues can be established.*
- [Commented](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3169#issuecomment-3214365725) in [crewAIInc/crewAI] on 2025-08-22.
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested saving a unique file in the project and has requested the relevant embedder to be included. The comment mentions that knowledge sources are processed and retrieved, typically using OpenAI models that necessitate an OpenAI key. However, since a different model is being utilized, either the OpenAI key should be provided, or the necessary embedder function should be configured in the project to ensure functionality.*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/3391) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: [BUG] Mem0 Storage metadata limit breach (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that using External Memory with Mem0 can lead to save request failures if the metadata exceeds 2000 characters due to including the assistant message, user message, and system prompt. To reproduce the issue, one should generate a response longer than 2000 characters. The expected behavior is for the system to function without issues. The comment indicates compatibility with macOS Sonoma, Python 3.11, and the latest versions of crewAI and its tools, while also mentioning a possible solution linked to issue #3390.*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/3390) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Adding user_interaction and agent_interaction directly from messages (2025-08-23).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the recent changes involve modifying how user_message and agent_message are handled. Instead of being included in the metadata, they are now added directly to the message during the save method call for Mem0 Storage. Additionally, the messages parameter has been removed from the metadata configuration, which has a character limit of 2000. These adjustments aim to streamline the data handling process within the system.*
