  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal suggested that the current architecture allows only one or two agents to work simultaneously. This limits the ability to handle multiple requests from the production side. Scaling beyond 10 agents can also introduce latency issues. To address this, @Vidit-Ostwal proposed exploring the use of Kafka to make Crew AI*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format support to the output_log_file. Currently, the file has a .txt format, which is not parsable. By adding JSON support, further analysis will be enabled. This suggestion partially addresses issue #1970. @Vidit-Ostwal is willing to contribute a pull request with this implementation.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested understanding the purpose of `use_vision set = True` when defining an agent. They question if the screenshot goes to the multimodal LLM for parsing or if it still falls back to scraping elements for decision-making. Additionally, they inquire if there's a cost metric to verify if multimodal*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support to save logs as a JSON file.
