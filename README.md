  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the method used for obtaining user input. The comment confirms that the implementation does not involve 'human_input'. Instead, the user input is received via a custom tool that leverages WebSocket communication. The questions are dispatched through the WebSocket, and the system then awaits the user's reply*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the behavior observed is primarily due to the `try-except` block implemented within the `crew-ai` framework. This framework employs this block intentionally to enable multiple attempts at problem-solving for agents. The `try-except` block allows the system to gracefully handle potential errors or exceptions during the agent's execution,*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested the addition of a new feature that allows users to incorporate runtime data from Human through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhancement streamlines the process of integrating real-time information from Human directly into the system. Furthermore, there are plans to expand this functionality by implementing websockets.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case. This addition ensures that a specific scenario is properly handled. The test case focuses on validating the behavior. This enhancement will help prevent regressions and maintain the reliability of the functionality. This contribution aims to improve code quality and robustness. The goal is*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2448, outlining key logic changes to streamline user memory configuration. The previous code's checks for `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` can be more efficient by verifying the `memory_config` with `mem0` as the provider. The suggested logic simplifies user memory initialization; if a `UserMemory` instance exists,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The process of creating a virtual environment during this execution incorrectly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes ensuring that `crewai_tools` is installed unconditionally,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the work done in issue #2422. The primary focus of this suggestion is to refine and improve the existing codebase by removing a specific test case that is deemed unnecessary or redundant. This action is intended to streamline the testing process, enhance the overall efficiency*
