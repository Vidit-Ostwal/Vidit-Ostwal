  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested initializing each language model (LLM), noting that initializing one and assigning it to others could work. Responding to a query about why OpenAI is the default LLM, @Vidit-Ostwal explained that OpenAI's API became the default due to its early adoption and widespread use, similar to a fallback*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that users can define their own Language Model and integrate it into the crew setup by utilizing the 'llm' parameter. This approach allows for customization of the Language Model used within the crew framework. By configuring the 'llm' parameter, users can specify the desired model, such as*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential solution to a prompt engineering problem. The suggestion involves providing the language model (LLM) with more information about a specific tool to improve its functionality. To achieve this, they propose replacing a particular function within the `base_tool.py` file. This updated function aims to enhance the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. Upon experimenting with Gemini, no comparable issue was encountered. The intention is to determine if the observed behavior is specific to a particular LLM implementation. Understanding the LLM in use is crucial for replicating the problem and*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method to view the final prompt sent to the LLM. Observing that using verbose mode does not provide sufficient information, Vidit-Ostwal has printed the prompt immediately before the LLM call to overcome the problem. A print statement was added to the crew_agent_executor.py file, specifically targeting the*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a system prompt for an AI People Information Specialist. This AI is designed to answer questions about individuals using a specific tool: "Search a JSON's content" which searches a local JSON file. The AI's goal is to analyze questions, use the tool to find information about people,*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested concern regarding the system's adaptability to potential changes in the structure of nested dictionaries. The concern arises from the possibility that the system might not handle variations in the dictionary keys. The main issue is that if the underlying `llm` decides to alter the nested dictionary structure*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested an addition of functionality that enables the incorporation of runtime data originating from Human through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This enhancement seeks to bridge a gap in data integration, thereby facilitating more comprehensive analysis and insights. Furthermore, there are plans to expand upon this foundational functionality*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260. This new test is designed to cover a specific scenario within the existing codebase, ensuring robustness. The test implementation focuses on validating the expected behavior under particular conditions, thus improving overall code reliability. This addition aims to proactively identify*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to fix issue #2448, focusing on simplifying the `UserMemory` configuration. The original code checked for both `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it. The proposed solution streamlines this by primarily verifying the existence of `memory_config`. The updated code directly initializes `self._user_memory` as a `UserMemory` instance, simplifying the conditional*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are used within a crew using the `crewai run` CLI command. This process generates a virtual environment that incorrectly identifies `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed irrespective of whether*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the existing work in pull request #2422. The focus of this suggestion is to refine the current implementation by removing an unnecessary test case. This modification aims to streamline the testing process and improve the overall efficiency of the codebase. By eliminating the redundant test,*
