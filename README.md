  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested initializing each item. A tip is to initialize one and assign the same large language model (LLM) to the others, which should work. OpenAI's API was chosen as the default LLM because it was among the first and most widely adopted. Other companies have made their APIs*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that users can define their own Large Language Model (LLM) and integrate it into the crew by using the 'llm' parameter. This provides flexibility in choosing and configuring the LLM that suits their specific needs. An example is provided to illustrate how to define an LLM using*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the problem lies in prompt engineering and believes providing the LLM with more information about the tool might resolve the issue. He proposes a solution involving a modified function. This function aims to enhance the description generation by including details about the tool's arguments, their types,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested inquiring about the specific large language model (LLM) being utilized. They mentioned having tested the scenario with Gemini and observed no issues. The purpose of the inquiry is to understand if the problem is specific to an LLM.*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a method to view the final prompt sent to the language model, noting that the verbose setting doesn't provide sufficient information. They pointed out the lack of visibility into the `final_prompt` before it reaches the LLM. To address this, they directly modified the `crew_agent_executor.py` file, specifically lines*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the prompt should provide the AI with a system message defining its role as a People Information Specialist, tasked with finding information about people using specific tools. The AI should analyze questions, use available tools to search for individuals, and provide concise summaries or state its*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a potential vulnerability concerning the application's resilience to changes in the structure of language model responses. The core issue is the application's dependency on a specific, nested dictionary format from the `llm`. If the `llm` were to alter the structure or keys within the nested dictionary, the*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that a recent pull request removes a validation in crewAI by allowing a dictionary-like structure. While this resolves the immediate issue, Vidit-Ostwal believes a more robust solution is needed. As the number of tools increases, the language model should learn to understand the required parameters by analyzing*

- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a new feature to incorporate runtime data from the Human interface using the command-line interface (CLI). This enhancement allows users to input and utilize real-time data obtained from Human directly through the CLI. The commenter also mentioned a future plan to expand this functionality further by*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260. This test case is aimed at ensuring the correct behavior and validation of the name when creating a domain using the DNS service. The suggested test validates that the system appropriately handles and rejects invalid domain names, preventing errors*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changes to address issue #2448, focusing on streamlining user memory configuration. The original logic was deemed inefficient due to its extensive checks. The updated code simplifies the process by primarily verifying the presence of `memory_config`. The updated logic uses the user_memory attribute for initialization, streamlining the original*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when using tools within a crew via the `crewai run` CLI command. The process creates a virtual environment that mistakenly treats `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed unconditionally, irrespective of whether*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the existing work in pull request #2422. This suggestion focuses on refining the current codebase by removing a specific test case. The rationale behind this action is to streamline the testing process, potentially improving efficiency and clarity. The removal aims to address specific issues or*
