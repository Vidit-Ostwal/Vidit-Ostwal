  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that after downgrading to version 0.203.1, the hallucination issues ceased. They inquired about a migration guide for upgrading to version 1+, noting its drastically different behavior and the challenges faced during the learning process with CrewAI. It was emphasized that while the previous version worked well, the upgrade caused significant issues. Additionally, @Vidit-Ostwal recommended adding a specific parameter in the latest version to fallback to a previous system, advocating for the use of the new native SDK instead of the old dependency.*
