  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring prompt engineering as a potential solution. The suggestion involves modifying the instructions given to the agent utilizing the tool. Instead of directly addressing the problem, the focus should be on instructing the agent to recognize and utilize a specific input format, such as `search_query`, when interacting*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested understanding how the user input is being received, inquiring if 'human_input' is being utilized. The response clarifies that 'human_input' is not being used; instead, the questions are transmitted via WebSocket and the system waits for the user's reply. This method is part of a custom tool. The*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested exploring alternative methods for running the crew setup. The suggestion involves testing the crew setup within a Jupyter Notebook environment, as well as executing it independently using a standard Python script, specifically "python.py". This approach aims to bypass the use of WebSockets in the initial setup and*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested verifying if a particular issue has been resolved in the latest version. The suggestion is based on a test conducted using a newly created project. The project was generated using the `crewai create crew Project-name` command. During the test, all Ruff checks were successfully passed, indicating a*

  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested gathering more detailed logs to diagnose the reported issue, particularly since a fresh installation and project creation using `crewai create crew <project_name>` worked without problems in their environment. This successful test suggests the problem might be specific to the reporter's setup. Vidit-Ostwal is requesting clarification on the*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the behavior observed is primarily due to the use of a `try-except` block within the `crew-ai` framework. This mechanism is implemented to enable multiple attempts to solve a task assigned to an agent. The `try-except` block allows the system to handle potential errors gracefully and retry*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/pull/251) in [crewAIInc/crewAI-tools]: Added Human Input from CLI (2025-03-31).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a feature to incorporate runtime data from Human through the Command Line Interface. This enhancement allows for the integration of real-time information gathered from Human into the system. Future plans include expanding this functionality using websockets. The intention is to enable seamless and dynamic updates of*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2484) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added test case for Issue #2260 (2025-03-26).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding a test case related to issue #2260. The suggestion aims to ensure proper handling and expected behavior within the system. This addition will help prevent regressions and maintain the stability of the functionality. The test case will be specifically useful for verifying the corrected behavior. Overall,*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2469) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Fixes user_memory configuration (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested modifications to the user memory configuration within the Crew class. The original logic checked for `self.memory_config` and `user_memory` within it, but the proposed change simplifies this by primarily verifying the existence of `memory_config`. If `user_memory` is a valid `UserMemory` instance, it's used directly. Otherwise, a new `UserMemory`*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2468) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Crewai_tools is an absolute dependency (2025-03-25).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a fix for issue #2361, which arises when tools are used within a crew alongside the `crewai run` command. The process creates a virtual environment that incorrectly recognizes `crewai_tools` as an optional dependency. To resolve this, Vidit-Ostwal proposes that `crewai_tools` should be installed universally, irrespective of whether*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/2423) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Changed the import error to show missing module files (2025-03-20).
  > *AI Summary: Vidit-Ostwal has suggested building upon the existing work in issue #2422. The focus of this suggestion is to refine the codebase by removing a test case that is deemed unnecessary or redundant. This action aims to streamline the testing suite, potentially improving efficiency and clarity. By eliminating the extraneous test*
