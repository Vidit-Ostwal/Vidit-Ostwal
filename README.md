  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that the unexpected behavior observed in the code is likely specific to the input tensors used. They analyzed the code and identified a particular condition that may trigger a warning about variance close to zero leading to instability in predictions. However, upon testing with different input tensors,*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested that `interpolate_inputs_and_add_conversation_history()` initializes all the parameters before the crew kickoff. The error occurs because it tries to find the `detail` parameter, which is not present. They recommend modifying the description of `task 2` to clarify that it should use the output from `task 1` without specifically specifying*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested updating the traces functionality to include `{prompt_number} : {trace}` for improved clarity. Traces should now display in the format: `{'prompt_1': {'name': 'claim_decomposition_prompt', 'input': ClaimDecompositionInput(response='Eiffel tower is in Paris'), 'output': ClaimDecompositionOutput(claims=['Eiffel tower is in Paris.'])}, 'prompt_2': {'name': 'n_l_i_statement_prompt', 'input': NLIStatementInput(context='Paris, France is a city where Eifel tower is*

  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested setting `output_log_file=True` when defining the crew to track if the mail sending task is being executed multiple times or if other agents are being called. They have also created a PR (#1985) to enhance the readability of the logs by saving them in JSON format. They are*

## üêõ Issues Raised
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/issues/1984) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: output_log_file should also suppport JSON format. (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding JSON format support to the output_log_file as the .txt format is not parsable. This will partially address issue #1970, allowing for further analysis. They are willing to contribute a pull request for this feature.*
- Raised an [issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/407) in [browser-use/browser-use]: Use of use_vision while defining agent (2025-01-26).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested clarifying the purpose of `use_vision set = True` when defining an agent. They question whether it enables multimodal language model (LLM) processing of screenshots or if it still relies on scraping elements. @Vidit-Ostwal also highlights that the only noticeable change with `use_vision = True` is the saving*

## üöÄ Pull Requests
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/1985) in [crewAIInc/crewAI]: Added functionality to have json format as well for the logs (2025-01-27).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested adding support for saving logs as JSON files. When initializing the crew, users can set output_log_file to True or provide a file name and enable save_as_json to True. The generated JSON file will include an array of JSON events, facilitating easy parsing and further processing.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1880) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Changed the parse_run_traces to include last 4 letters of run_id (2025-01-25).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested a change to the parse_run_traces function to include the last 4 letters of the run_id of the trace. This change will create a unique key for every call, ensuring better identification and organization of trace data.*
- Opened a [PR](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/1879) in [explodinggradients/ragas]: Change the validate_samples functionality (2025-01-24).
  > *AI Summary: @Vidit-Ostwal has suggested changing the functionality of the validate_samples function to provide specific indices of the samples that cause validation issues. This modification improves the debugging process by pinpointing the problematic samples, enabling efficient resolution of data quality issues.*
